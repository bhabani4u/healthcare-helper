      What to Do When You Receive a Diagnosis
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Going to the doctor is challenging for people at any age. Nearly half of all Americans feel anxious before a doctor’s appointment. Anxiety about a doctor’s visit is typically attributed to a lack of knowledge needed to handle the information received at a doctor’s visit, anxiety about medical costs, fear related to a necessary test or procedure to be conducted, and fear of receiving a negative diagnosis. This anxiety causes patients to act slowly on their medical needs, or avoid visits to their doctor altogether, further impacting their health.</p>
      <p>In this article, we are going to focus on how to effectively process diagnostic information you receive in order to do the best for your health.</p>
      <p>While no one wishes to receive bad news, it is important that we face it squarely and take quick action in order to address the diagnosis as early as possible. Quick action may be the difference between nipping a problem in the bud, or allowing time for a disease to worsen, further complicating our health problems. If you know yourself well enough to know that this fear may paralyze you from taking action, there is no need to read on at the moment. Instead, you will gain the most by working directly with a therapist to address this fear. Fears can be surmounted, no matter how uncomfortable they may make us feel. For everyone else, read on.</p>
      <p>We live in a time where knowledge and data collected throughout the past thousands of years has been digitized. Like the connect the dots puzzles we used to draw as children, scientists and data analysts are connecting the dots among an overwhelming amount of digitized data, making it possible to see connections between things where many never would have guessed in generations past. For instance, today, it is clear that African Americans experience health problems differently than other races, leading to a 30% higher chance of high blood pressure, and being more prone to diabetes. Secondly, we know that while medical treatments are often standardized regardless of race. Connecting the dots between these two means that we can now see better health outcomes when treatment for African Americans is nuanced to meet their needs.</p>
      <p>Knowledge is power. But not all knowledge is helpful. We must cultivate our health and medical knowledge from credible sources if we are to make sound decisions affecting our lives. When we receive a diagnosis from a doctor, our typical experience as laypersons is to have extremely limited reference to what is being described, putting us in a difficult position. If we don’t understand the words being used to describe our condition, how can we possibly understand our diagnosis? And even if we have some sense of what certain words mean, how can we be sure we are fully grasping our situation accurately, being that we are not medical doctors?</p>
      <p>There are no easy answers in healthcare, but there are steps you can take to protect yourself. Here are 5:</p>

      <h2>Come with a trusted family member or friend who can take notes.</h2>
      <p>Being with another person who cares for you will provide you both with the opportunity to take in the information provided by your doctor, and to be able to discuss it together afterwards. It is far too easy, even in simple conversations, to misunderstand what another person is communicating, or to focus on one aspect of a conversation and miss other key parts. Having someone else involved can be extremely helpful as you process information in the weeks and months to come.</p>

      <h2>Ask your doctor if you may record your conversation</h2>
      <p>Entering into a conversation that requires your concentration can make it difficult to retain important information by memory once you leave the office. Inevitably, you will forget many parts, and remember a few key parts. By recording your conversation, or at the very least, taking notes on the most important aspects, you can focus on your conversation with your doctor, then return to your notes afterwards in order to review what was discussed.</p>

      <h2>Remind your doctor that this is all new to you, and it is important for you to understand exactly what you are being told, and that this will require your doctor to slow down and allow you to ask questions</h2>
      <p>Information is only as useful as your ability to process it. Doctors, having dealt with many of the same diseases over the course of decades, sometimes take for granted that their diagnosis may be simple to understand. It is important to remind the doctor of the effort you will need to make in order to grasp what they say to you.</p>
      <p>If a doctor is providing you with new information that you don’t understand, it doesn’t actually help to continue the conversation until you are on the same page. Your doctor may need to slow down, and simply certain things until you feel comfortable. Given that time with a doctor is also limited, you may need to ask the doctor if it is better to schedule a second appointment to continue the conversation.</p>

      <p>Once you feel confident that you understand what a doctor is communicating, check to see if you have asked the following questions. Note that some of these questions may not apply to your situation.</p>
      <p>1. Are there any resources online that you suggest I study in order to better understand my situation?</p>
      <p>2. Are there any support groups or resources that I should reach out to in order to get additional help?</p>
      <p>3. What impact will this have on my daily life? How should I prepare?</p>
      <p>4. What alternatives are there for treatment, and how may these impact my recovery?</p>
      <p>5. Is there anything that I could do to improve my diagnosis?</p>
      <p>6. What would you do if you were in my shoes?</p>
