      Is the World Getting Worse? The Answer is No!
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>
        In an era of seemingly endless headlines about violence and conflict, it’s easy to believe the world is spiraling into chaos. However, this perception is often misleading. According to Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker’s research, outlined in his book The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined, the world has actually become significantly less violent since the end of World War II. The decline of violence spans everything from large-scale wars to everyday crime, and while this progress is not always obvious, it’s supported by historical trends and statistical data.
      </p>

      <h2>The Decline of Violence</h2>
      <p>
        Pinker’s research highlights how humanity has consistently experienced a reduction in violent behaviors over the centuries. His findings challenge the commonly held belief that we live in an exceptionally violent time. To be sure, history is filled with brutal wars, genocides, and countless acts of cruelty. However, when you compare today’s violence rates with earlier periods, such as the medieval or even 19th-century times, a clear downward trend emerges.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of Pinker’s arguments is that the advancement of democratic governance, better social policies, and more widespread respect for human rights have contributed to this decline. In earlier centuries, public executions, gruesome punishments, and tribal warfare were much more common, with little legal protection for citizens. As societies became more organized, laws, diplomacy, and cooperation began to reduce instances of conflict.
      </p>

      <h2>A Historical Turning Point: Post-World War II</h2>
      <p>
        The world has witnessed a major decrease in violence, especially since the end of World War II in 1945. After the devastation caused by two world wars in the first half of the 20th century, the international community began to form alliances, treaties, and organizations like the United Nations aimed at preventing future global conflicts. Moreover, the Cold War that followed, though tense, did not lead to the large-scale conflicts that were once the norm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since World War II, the frequency of wars between major powers has greatly diminished. The nuclear deterrent, which could cause unimaginable destruction, paradoxically contributed to keeping peace between superpowers. Instead of nations battling each other on the field, conflicts have been more diplomatic or economic.
      </p>
      <p>
        The decline in homicide rates is equally significant. For example, statistics in major cities such as Los Angeles demonstrate that the homicide rate today is significantly lower than it was in the early 1990s. Advancements in law enforcement, crime prevention techniques, and economic growth have contributed to fewer violent crimes overall.
      </p>

      <h2>Social Media and the Perception of Violence</h2>
      <p>
        One of the major reasons people believe that the world is becoming more dangerous is the role of media and, more recently, social media. The constant bombardment of violent imagery, news coverage, and reports about conflicts from every corner of the world has heightened people’s perception of danger. This relentless exposure creates a feedback loop in which people assume violence is on the rise, even when the data suggests otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Social media, with its 24/7 news cycles and user-generated content, has amplified this perception further. When events like mass shootings or terrorist attacks occur, they are instantly broadcast across platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, making them seem more frequent than they actually are. While these events are tragic and should not be dismissed, the truth is that they are often exceptions, not the rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sensationalism of modern media also tends to focus more on violent events because they grab attention, generating more clicks, views, and engagement. But this focus creates a skewed narrative that doesn't reflect the overall decrease in violence worldwide.
      </p>

      <h2>The Case of Los Angeles: Decreasing Crime Rates</h2>
      <p>
        Take Los Angeles as an example of this disconnect between perception and reality. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Los Angeles was known for its high rates of gang violence, murders, and violent crime. At its peak in 1992, the city recorded 1,092 homicides. However, over the past 30 years, the homicide rate has drastically fallen, with 2022 recording approximately 382 murders — a significant reduction.
      </p>
      <p>
        This downward trend mirrors that of other major U.S. cities. The reasons for this reduction are multi-faceted: better policing, community outreach programs, and improved economic conditions. Yet, if you were to consume only media headlines or sensationalized crime stories, you might be led to believe the opposite.
      </p>

      <h2>The “Better Angels” of Human Nature</h2>
      <p>
        Steven Pinker’s The Better Angels of Our Nature emphasizes that the world is not as bad as many perceive. In fact, we are living in one of the most peaceful periods in human history. This doesn’t mean that violence has disappeared, nor should it imply complacency, but it is important to recognize how far we've come.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pinker points out several forces, or “better angels,” that have guided us toward peace. These include empathy, self-control, moral reasoning, and the development of societal institutions that discourage violence. As democratic principles and human rights have expanded, violent tendencies have declined, both within and between nations.
      </p>

      <h2>Steps to Maintain Perspective and Stay Informed</h2>
      <p>
        While the world is less violent than it once was, the constant barrage of news can still make us feel anxious and fearful. Here are a few tips for staying informed without falling into the trap of believing that the world is descending into chaos:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-unstyled">
        <li>1. <strong>Understand Statistics:</strong> Take the time to look up crime and violence statistics in your local area and beyond. Real data can provide a more balanced view of trends in violence.</li>
        <li>2. <strong>Limit Social Media Exposure:</strong> Social media is often designed to heighten emotions. If you find yourself feeling anxious or overwhelmed, take a break from platforms that focus on sensationalized content.</li>
        <li>3. <strong>Focus on Positive News:</strong> Seek out positive developments happening worldwide. Many media outlets focus solely on negative stories, but there are numerous examples of humanitarian progress and peaceful initiatives that don’t always make the headlines.</li>
        <li>4. <strong>Engage in Community:</strong> One of the best ways to feel safe and secure is by engaging in your community. Whether it’s through local events, volunteering, or participating in a neighborhood watch program, getting involved can foster a sense of belonging and reduce feelings of fear.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The World is Actually Improving, Despite Perception to the Contrary</h2>
      <p>
        While it may seem counterintuitive, the world is indeed becoming less violent, as evidenced by the significant decline in global wars, homicide rates, and other violent crimes. As individuals, we must recognize the role that media and social media play in shaping our perceptions of violence. By staying informed, understanding the historical trends, and keeping a balanced perspective, we can counter the notion that the world is spiraling into violence.
      </p>

        The next time you come across alarming headlines, remember the words of Steven Pinker: humanity is progressing, and the data is there to prove it.
