                <p>To maximize your Social Security benefits, you may prefer to wait until age 70 before retiring. While
                  Social Security will allow you to begin receiving benefits at age 62, the longer you delay receiving
                  benefits, the larger your monthly benefit will be. Currently, the longest you may wait to maximize
                  your
                  benefits is age 70.</p>
