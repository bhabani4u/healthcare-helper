    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>The brain is the control center of our thoughts, emotions, memories, and behavior. It’s responsible for everything from solving complex problems to the simple act of breathing. Like other parts of our body, the brain changes as we age, and understanding these changes can help us take steps to maintain brain health throughout life. By engaging in specific activities, eating brain-healthy foods, and knowing when to see a doctor, we can give our brains the boost they need to stay sharp.</p>

      <h2>How the Brain Changes Across Milestones in Age</h2>
      <p>Our brain develops and changes from childhood into adulthood and continues to adapt into old age. Here’s a brief overview of how the brain evolves through different life stages:</p>

      <h2>Activities to Maintain Brain Health</h2>
      <p>No matter your age, there are various activities you can incorporate into your daily routine to support brain health. Here are some of the most effective:</p>

      <p><strong>1. Exercise Regularly:</strong></p>
      <p>Physical activity improves blood flow to the brain, promotes the growth of new brain cells, and supports overall brain health. Even moderate exercise like walking, yoga, or dancing can have significant benefits.</p>

      <p><strong>2. Stay Mentally Active:</strong></p>
      <p>Activities like puzzles, reading, learning new skills, or engaging in creative hobbies keep your brain sharp. Challenge your brain with tasks that require problem-solving and critical thinking to promote neuroplasticity (the brain’s ability to adapt and form new connections).</p>

      <p><strong>3. Be Social:</strong></p>
      <p>Social engagement stimulates brain function and can help protect against cognitive decline. Regular conversations, spending time with friends and family, and participating in group activities can strengthen cognitive function and emotional well-being.</p>

      <p><strong>4. Get Enough Sleep:</strong></p>
      <p>Sleep is crucial for brain health as it allows your brain to consolidate memories and flush out toxins. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night to give your brain the rest it needs.</p>

      <h2>Brain-Boosting Foods</h2>
      <p>The foods we eat play a significant role in maintaining brain health. Here are some foods that can help reduce cognitive decline and support brain function:</p>

      <p><strong>1. Leafy Greens (Spinach, kale, collards):</strong></p>
      <p>Rich in vitamins and antioxidants, these vegetables support brain health by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress.</p>

      <p><strong>2. Fatty Fish (Salmon, sardines, mackerel):</strong></p>
      <p>Fatty fish are high in omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for brain function and reduce the risk of dementia.</p>

      <p><strong>3. Berries (Blueberries, strawberries, blackberries):</strong></p>
      <p>Berries contain antioxidants that help prevent oxidative damage to brain cells and improve communication between neurons.</p>

      <p><strong>4. Nuts and Seeds (Walnuts, almonds, flaxseeds):</strong></p>
      <p>These are rich in healthy fats, antioxidants, and vitamin E, which support cognitive function and protect against age-related decline.</p>

      <p><strong>5. Whole Grains (Brown rice, oats, quinoa):</strong></p>
      <p>Whole grains provide a steady release of glucose, the brain’s primary energy source, which helps with concentration and mental clarity.</p>

      <h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>
      <p>While age-related cognitive changes are normal, there are certain warning signs that may indicate abnormal cognitive decline, such as dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. It’s important to see a doctor if you or a loved one experience any of the following symptoms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Significant Memory Loss:</strong> Frequently forgetting important information, such as the names of close family members, or having trouble remembering recent events.</li>
        <li><strong>Difficulty with Daily Tasks:</strong> Struggling with familiar tasks, such as following a recipe, managing finances, or navigating familiar places.</li>
        <li><strong>Language and Communication Problems:</strong> Finding it hard to follow conversations, find the right words, or recall common names or terms.</li>
        <li><strong>Disorientation:</strong> Becoming confused about time, place, or familiar surroundings.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Early detection of cognitive decline can lead to earlier interventions, which may slow the progression of certain conditions. If you notice any of these signs in yourself or a loved one, it’s crucial to consult with a healthcare provider to assess the situation and discuss potential treatments or lifestyle adjustments.</p>

      <h2>Take Charge of Your Brain Health</h2>
      <p>Your brain is responsible for every thought, emotion, memory, and behavior, so it’s important to nurture it as you age. By incorporating brain-healthy foods into your diet, staying mentally and physically active, and seeking medical advice if necessary, you can help maintain cognitive function and enjoy a healthier, sharper mind throughout life.</p>
      <p>Incorporate regular physical exercise, eat brain-boosting foods like leafy greens and fatty fish, engage in mentally stimulating activities, and stay socially connected to give your brain the boost it needs to thrive at any age.</p>
