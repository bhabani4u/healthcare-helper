    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most common forms of cognitive decline, affecting millions of people worldwide. Though it is often associated with aging, many people are unsure how it differs from other cognitive diseases and how it relates to dementia. Understanding Alzheimer’s, its risk factors, and what we can do to reduce our risk can help improve our health as we age.</p>
      <p>In this article, we’ll take a closer look at what Alzheimer’s is, how it differs from other cognitive diseases, the percentage of the population at risk, ways to reduce risk, and how to get tested for it.</p>

      <h2>What is Alzheimer’s?</h2>
      <p>Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects memory, thinking, and behavior. It is the most common cause of dementia, which refers to the general loss of cognitive abilities that interfere with daily life. Alzheimer’s is characterized by the buildup of abnormal proteins in the brain, including beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles, which cause damage to neurons and impair communication between brain cells.</p>
      <p>The hallmark symptoms of Alzheimer’s include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Memory loss (especially short-term memory)</li>
        <li>Difficulty with problem-solving and decision-making</li>
        <li>Confusion about time or place</li>
        <li>Changes in mood and behavior</li>
        <li>Difficulty with language and communication</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As the disease progresses, these symptoms worsen, eventually leading to significant cognitive decline and the inability to carry out basic daily activities.</p>

      <h2>How Alzheimer’s Differs From Other Cognitive Diseases</h2>
      <p>Alzheimer’s is often confused with other cognitive diseases, but it’s important to distinguish it from other conditions like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Vascular Dementia:</strong> This form of dementia is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, often due to strokes or other cardiovascular issues. It results in impaired judgment, difficulty with planning, and slow thought processes.</li>
        <li><strong>Lewy Body Dementia:</strong> This disease is associated with abnormal protein deposits called Lewy bodies in the brain. In addition to memory loss, it causes visual hallucinations, sleep disturbances, and movement problems similar to Parkinson’s disease.</li>
        <li><strong>Frontotemporal Dementia:</strong> This condition primarily affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain and is associated with changes in personality, behavior, and language.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Alzheimer’s is specifically linked to the destruction of neurons due to the buildup of beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles, while other cognitive diseases are caused by different mechanisms like blood flow issues or protein deposits unrelated to Alzheimer’s.</p>

      <h2>How Alzheimer’s Relates to Dementia</h2>
      <p>Alzheimer’s is the leading cause of dementia, a broader term used to describe a group of symptoms that affect memory, thinking, and social abilities severely enough to interfere with daily life. Dementia is not a specific disease but rather a syndrome caused by different brain diseases, with Alzheimer’s accounting for about 60-80% of all dementia cases.</p>
      <p>In other words, Alzheimer’s is a type of dementia, but not all dementia is Alzheimer’s. Other forms of dementia, like vascular dementia and Lewy body dementia, have different causes but share similar symptoms of cognitive decline.</p>

      <h2>What Percentage of the Population is at Risk for Alzheimer’s?</h2>
      <p>The risk of developing Alzheimer’s increases significantly with age. While the exact cause is not fully understood, several risk factors have been identified:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> Alzheimer’s mostly affects individuals aged 65 and older. In fact, the Alzheimer’s Association estimates that 1 in 9 people aged 65 and older in the U.S. have Alzheimer’s disease.</li>
        <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Individuals with a family history of Alzheimer’s are at higher risk. Certain genes, such as the APOE-e4 gene, are known to increase the likelihood of developing the disease.</li>
        <li><strong>Lifestyle Factors:</strong> Conditions like high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes, as well as smoking and lack of exercise, can also increase the risk of Alzheimer’s.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>According to estimates, by 2050, 12.7 million Americans could be living with Alzheimer’s if no cure or effective prevention is found. With the aging population growing, the number of people at risk for the disease continues to rise.</p>

      <h2>How to Reduce Your Risk of Alzheimer’s</h2>
      <p>While age and genetics play a role in Alzheimer’s risk, there are several lifestyle changes that can help reduce the likelihood of developing the disease:</p>
      <p><strong>1. Stay Mentally Active:</strong> Engaging in activities that challenge your brain, such as puzzles, learning new skills, reading, or playing a musical instrument, can help maintain cognitive function and create new neural connections.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Exercise Regularly:</strong> Physical activity increases blood flow to the brain and promotes brain health. Aim for at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise, such as walking or cycling, most days of the week.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Eat a Brain-Healthy Diet:</strong> The Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and healthy fats, has been associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer’s. Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, such as salmon, may also support brain function.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Manage Cardiovascular Health:</strong> High blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity increase the risk of Alzheimer’s. Managing these conditions with medication, diet, and exercise can reduce risk.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Stay Socially Connected:</strong> Social engagement helps maintain cognitive function. Regular interactions with friends, family, or participating in community activities can lower the risk of cognitive decline.</p>

      <h2>How to Get Tested for Alzheimer’s</h2>
      <p>Currently, there is no single test that can diagnose Alzheimer’s definitively, but doctors use a combination of assessments to determine if someone is at risk or showing signs of the disease:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cognitive and Memory Tests:</strong> Doctors often use cognitive assessments to evaluate memory, problem-solving skills, and language ability.</li>
        <li><strong>Neurological Exams:</strong> These tests assess reflexes, coordination, muscle tone, and balance to detect neurological issues related to Alzheimer’s.</li>
        <li><strong>Brain Imaging:</strong> MRI and CT scans can help rule out other causes of cognitive decline, such as strokes or tumors, and detect brain shrinkage associated with Alzheimer’s.</li>
        <li><strong>Biomarker Tests:</strong> In some cases, doctors may use spinal fluid tests or blood tests to measure levels of beta-amyloid and tau proteins, which are linked to Alzheimer’s.</li>
        <li><strong>Genetic Testing:</strong> If there is a family history of Alzheimer’s, genetic tests can identify whether a person carries the APOE-e4 gene, which increases the risk of developing the disease.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Alzheimer’s is a complex disease, but understanding its risk factors and taking proactive steps can help reduce your likelihood of developing the disease. By staying mentally and physically active, eating a brain-healthy diet, and managing cardiovascular health, you can support your brain’s function as you age. If you’re concerned about your memory or cognitive health, consider talking to your doctor about getting tested.</p>
      <p>Focus on small daily habits—exercise, social connections, and mental challenges—that can help keep your brain sharp and reduce your risk of Alzheimer’s.</p>
