      <h2 class="m-0">What is Parkinson’s Disease?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects movement. It occurs when nerve cells in the brain, specifically in the area known as the substantia nigra, become damaged or die. These nerve cells produce dopamine, a chemical messenger that helps control smooth and coordinated muscle movements. When dopamine levels drop due to nerve cell damage, individuals begin to experience motor symptoms such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tremors (shaking)</li>
        <li>Stiffness or rigidity in muscles</li>
        <li>Slowed movements (bradykinesia)</li>
        <li>Difficulty with balance and coordination</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition to these physical symptoms, Parkinson’s can also lead to non-motor symptoms such as mood changes, cognitive decline, and sleep disturbances.</p>

      <h2>How Parkinson’s Differs from Other Cognitive Diseases</h2>
      <p>Unlike Alzheimer’s, which primarily affects memory and thinking, Parkinson’s is more focused on movement disorders. However, both diseases can involve cognitive decline in later stages, and Parkinson’s can eventually cause Parkinson’s disease dementia. One of the distinguishing features of Parkinson’s disease is its connection to Lewy bodies—clumps of abnormal protein deposits that develop inside brain cells.</p>
      <p>Lewy bodies are also present in Lewy body dementia (LBD), which is another type of cognitive disorder. These abnormal protein deposits interfere with brain function and can contribute to both motor and cognitive symptoms. While Parkinson’s disease primarily affects movement early on, Lewy body dementia is associated with cognitive decline from the start. This overlap in symptoms is one reason it’s so important to understand the distinctions between various neurological diseases.</p>

      <h2>How Parkinson’s Relates to Dementia</h2>
      <p>Parkinson’s disease is primarily a movement disorder, but as the disease progresses, many individuals also experience cognitive decline, leading to Parkinson’s disease dementia. This form of dementia affects attention, judgment, problem-solving, and memory. While not everyone with Parkinson’s will develop dementia, approximately 50-80% of people with Parkinson’s may experience some form of cognitive decline.</p>
      <p>It's important to note that dementia is a general term for cognitive decline that interferes with daily life, and there are different types of dementia depending on the underlying cause. For those with Parkinson’s, cognitive issues typically appear after motor symptoms, distinguishing it from other types of dementia like Alzheimer’s or Lewy body dementia, where cognitive symptoms are more prominent earlier on.</p>

      <h2>Who is at Risk for Parkinson’s?</h2>
      <p>The exact cause of Parkinson’s is still unknown, but research has identified several risk factors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> The risk of developing Parkinson’s increases with age, with most cases diagnosed after age 60. However, around 10-20% of cases, known as early-onset Parkinson’s, occur before the age of 50, as in Michael J. Fox’s case.</li>
        <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> While most cases of Parkinson’s are sporadic (meaning they occur randomly), genetics can play a role in some cases. Certain genetic mutations, such as the LRRK2 gene, increase the risk of developing the disease, though only about 15% of people with Parkinson’s have a family history of the condition.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Factors:</strong> Exposure to certain toxins, such as pesticides or heavy metals, has been linked to an increased risk of Parkinson’s. Additionally, traumatic brain injuries, such as those experienced by athletes, may also raise the risk.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>According to the Parkinson’s Foundation, nearly 1 million Americans are living with Parkinson’s disease, and that number is expected to rise to 1.2 million by 2030.</p>

      <h2>How to Reduce the Risk of Parkinson’s</h2>
      <p>While there is no guaranteed way to prevent Parkinson’s, certain lifestyle habits may help lower your risk:</p>
      <p><strong>1. Exercise Regularly:</strong> Regular physical activity, particularly aerobic exercise, has been shown to promote brain health and may reduce the risk of Parkinson’s. Exercise can help maintain balance, flexibility, and strength while boosting dopamine levels.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Eat a Healthy Diet:</strong> A diet rich in antioxidants, such as fruits and vegetables, may help protect brain cells. The Mediterranean diet, which includes fish, whole grains, and healthy fats, has been associated with a lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Stay Socially and Mentally Engaged:</strong> Engaging in mentally stimulating activities, such as puzzles, reading, or learning new skills, can help keep your brain sharp. Social interaction is also crucial for maintaining cognitive health.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Protect Yourself from Environmental Risks:</strong> Minimize exposure to toxins like pesticides, and if you’ve experienced head trauma, take steps to protect yourself, such as wearing helmets during activities that pose a risk of head injury.</p>

      <h2>How to Get Tested for Parkinson’s</h2>
      <p>There is no single test to definitively diagnose Parkinson’s disease. Instead, doctors use a combination of tools to assess symptoms and rule out other conditions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Neurological Exam:</strong> A neurologist will evaluate your motor skills, including muscle stiffness, tremors, and balance. They will also ask about your medical history and any non-motor symptoms you may be experiencing.</li>
        <li><strong>Imaging Tests:</strong> While imaging tests like MRI or CT scans can’t diagnose Parkinson’s, they help rule out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms.</li>
        <li><strong>DaTscan:</strong> This specialized imaging test can detect dopamine function in the brain and help doctors differentiate Parkinson’s from other movement disorders.</li>
        <li><strong>Genetic Testing:</strong> In rare cases, genetic testing may be used to identify mutations linked to Parkinson’s, especially if there is a strong family history of the disease.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Taking Control of Your Brain Health</h2>
      <p>Parkinson’s disease, while primarily a movement disorder, can also lead to cognitive decline and dementia in later stages. By understanding the risk factors, taking steps to maintain brain health through exercise and diet, and seeking medical advice if you notice early symptoms, you can take proactive control of your health.</p>
      <p>If you or a loved one are experiencing any of the early signs of Parkinson’s, consult a doctor for a thorough evaluation. Early detection and treatment can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.</p>
