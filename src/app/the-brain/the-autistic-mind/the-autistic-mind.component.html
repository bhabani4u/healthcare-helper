      <p>Autism, also known as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), encompasses a wide range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech, and nonverbal communication. Autism exists on a spectrum, meaning that the presentation of behaviors and abilities can vary significantly from one individual to another. While some people with autism may need significant support, others can live independently, excelling in their careers and personal lives.</p>
      <p>In this article, we’ll explore the autism spectrum, the prevalence of autism, gender differences in autistic behavior, and how autism is described today. We'll also examine whether the term "Asperger's" is still used in the diagnosis of autism.</p>

      <h2>The Autism Spectrum</h2>
      <p>Autism is referred to as a spectrum because individuals with autism may experience a wide range of symptoms, abilities, and challenges. Some people with autism may have severe difficulties with communication, while others may have extraordinary abilities in specific areas like mathematics, art, or music. This variation is why autism is now understood as a spectrum disorder.</p>

      <h2>How Many People Are Autistic?</h2>
      <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 1 in 36 children in the United States is diagnosed with autism, which has steadily increased over the past few decades. This increase is likely due to improved diagnostic methods and greater awareness of the condition.</p>
      <p>Autism is typically diagnosed in early childhood, but some individuals may not receive a diagnosis until adolescence or adulthood, especially those with milder symptoms.</p>

      <h2>Differences in Autism Between Men and Women</h2>
      <p>Autism is more commonly diagnosed in males than females, with about four times more males being diagnosed with autism than females. However, research suggests that autism may be underdiagnosed in females. Women with autism may exhibit different behaviors than men, which can make their symptoms harder to recognize.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Autistic men:</strong> Tend to show more noticeable signs of restricted and repetitive behaviors, such as intense fixations on hobbies or activities. They are also more likely to struggle with social communication.</li>
        <li><strong>Autistic women:</strong> Often "mask" or hide their symptoms by mimicking social behaviors, which can make them appear more socially adept than they feel. Women may have interests that align more closely with societal norms, such as focusing on literature or animals, making their autism less obvious.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Due to these differences in presentation, many women go undiagnosed or are misdiagnosed with other conditions such as anxiety or depression.</p>

      <h2>Terminology: How We Talk About Autism Today</h2>
      <p>Autism terminology has evolved over the years. In the past, terms like Asperger’s Syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder—not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) were used to describe individuals on the milder end of the spectrum. However, these terms are no longer part of the official diagnostic criteria.</p>
      <p>In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association updated the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) to include all autism-related conditions under the single diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Asperger’s Syndrome, once considered a separate condition, is now recognized as part of the broader autism spectrum. People who were previously diagnosed with Asperger’s may still refer to themselves by that label, but it is no longer used in formal diagnoses.</p>
      <p>Common terms used today include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): The umbrella term for all levels of autism, from mild to severe.</li>
        <li>Neurodivergent: A broader term used to describe individuals who think or behave in ways that differ from the societal "norm." People with autism, ADHD, and other developmental differences are considered neurodivergent.</li>
        <li>Level 1, 2, 3 Autism: These levels are used in diagnosis to describe the amount of support a person with autism requires. Level 1 individuals need the least support, while Level 3 individuals need significant support.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Reducing the Effects of Cognitive Decline in Autism</h2>
      <p>While autism is a lifelong condition, there are several strategies and practices that can help support brain health and reduce cognitive decline:</p>
      <p><strong>1. Engage in Regular Physical Activity:</strong> Exercise helps maintain cognitive health and can reduce anxiety, which is common in individuals with autism. Activities like walking, swimming, or yoga can provide physical and mental benefits.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Maintain a Balanced Diet:</strong> Nutrition plays a crucial role in brain function. Eating a balanced diet that includes fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and omega-3 fatty acids can help support brain health.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Develop Social Skills:</strong> Building social skills through therapy, group activities, or one-on-one support can help autistic individuals navigate social situations more effectively and reduce feelings of isolation.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Participate in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):</strong> CBT can help individuals with autism manage stress, anxiety, and repetitive behaviors by learning coping strategies and mindfulness techniques.</p>

      <h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>
      <p>If you or a loved one are experiencing behaviors or challenges that may align with autism, it is important to seek a formal evaluation. Early diagnosis and intervention can make a significant difference in managing symptoms and improving quality of life. You should see a doctor if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A child is not meeting developmental milestones, such as speaking or making eye contact.</li>
        <li>An individual has difficulty interacting socially or seems overly focused on specific routines.</li>
        <li>Sensory sensitivities, such as aversions to loud noises or certain textures, disrupt daily life.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Understanding and Supporting the Autistic Mind</h2>
      <p>Autism is a spectrum, with individuals experiencing a wide range of symptoms and challenges. With a growing understanding of the autistic mind, we can create a more inclusive society that celebrates neurodiversity and supports individuals in reaching their full potential.</p>
      <p>If you suspect you or a loved one may be on the autism spectrum, seek out a healthcare professional for evaluation and guidance. By understanding autism and the spectrum it exists on, we can all help create a more supportive world for neurodivergent individuals.</p>
