      <h4>Common Types of Scams</h4>

      <p><strong>1. Phone Scams</strong></p>
      <p>
        Phone scams often involve someone pretending to be from a legitimate organization, such as the IRS, Social Security, or a utility company. Scammers might threaten you with fines or jail time unless you make immediate payments. Some may even offer you a "free" prize, but only if you give them your personal information or credit card number.
      </p>
      <p><strong>o Warning Signs:</strong> If someone calls you out of the blue and asks for your Social Security number, credit card information, or other personal details, be cautious. Legitimate agencies will never demand this kind of information over the phone.</p>
      <p><strong>o What You Can Do:</strong> Hang up and call the organization directly using the official phone number listed on their website to verify the call. Do not rely on the number the caller provides.</p>

      <p><strong>2. Text Scams</strong></p>
      <p>
        Scam texts, also known as "smishing," involve sending messages that try to trick you into clicking on a link or providing personal information. They may claim you’ve won a prize, there’s a problem with your bank account, or that your package delivery has failed.
      </p>
      <p><strong>o Warning Signs:</strong> Beware of unexpected texts with urgent language or requests for personal information. Scammers may also spoof (fake) legitimate businesses in their texts.</p>
      <p><strong>o What You Can Do:</strong> Do not click on any links or reply to the text message. If you think the message might be real, contact the company directly using their official website or phone number to check the status of any claimed issues.</p>

      <p><strong>3. Mail Scams</strong></p>
      <p>
        Scammers may use traditional mail to send fake lottery letters, sweepstakes, or charity solicitations, claiming you’ve won money or need to send money to claim your prize. Others may send fake bills demanding immediate payment.
      </p>
      <p><strong>o Warning Signs:</strong> Any letter asking you to pay upfront to claim a prize or asking for personal details is likely a scam. Legitimate companies don’t ask you to send money to receive winnings.</p>
      <p><strong>o What You Can Do:</strong> If you receive a suspicious letter, don’t respond or send money. You can report potential mail scams to the U.S. Postal Inspection Service for further investigation.</p>

      <p><strong>4. Email Scams (Phishing)</strong></p>
      <p>
        Email phishing scams often appear to come from a trusted company, like your bank or an online retailer, asking you to update your account information or click a link to resolve an issue. The goal is to steal your login information or infect your computer with malware.
      </p>
      <p><strong>o Warning Signs:</strong> Look out for emails with unfamiliar addresses, spelling or grammar errors, or urgent requests for personal information. Scammers often use logos and designs that look like they’re from a real company.</p>
      <p><strong>o What You Can Do:</strong> Never click on links or download attachments from suspicious emails. Instead, visit the company’s official website and log in to your account to verify if there’s an actual issue.</p>

      <p><strong>5. Computer Virus Scams</strong></p>
      <p>
        Scammers may try to convince you that your computer has a virus and that they can help you fix it—for a fee. They might contact you by phone or email, claiming to be tech support from a major company like Microsoft or Apple.
      </p>
      <p><strong>o Warning Signs:</strong> No legitimate tech support company will contact you unsolicited. If someone asks you to grant them remote access to your computer or demands payment for a supposed virus fix, it’s likely a scam.</p>
      <p><strong>o What You Can Do:</strong> If you think your computer has a virus, contact a trusted tech professional directly or use antivirus software to run a scan. Never allow a stranger to access your computer remotely.</p>

      <h4>How to Protect Yourself from Scams</h4>
      <p>
        Here are some simple but effective steps to protect yourself from falling victim to scams:
      </p>

      <p><strong>1. Pause Before Responding</strong></p>
      <p>
        If you get an unexpected call, email, text, or letter, take a moment to pause. Scammers rely on people reacting quickly out of fear or urgency. By pausing, you give yourself time to assess the situation rationally.
      </p>

      <p><strong>2. Verify the Source</strong></p>
      <p>
        Always verify who is contacting you. If someone claims to be from a legitimate company or government agency, hang up or ignore the message and contact the organization directly through their official website or phone number.
      </p>

      <p><strong>3. Do Not Share Personal Information</strong></p>
      <p>
        Never provide personal details like your Social Security number, credit card information, or bank account numbers to someone who contacts you unsolicited. Legitimate organizations will never ask for this information through phone calls, texts, or emails.
      </p>

      <p><strong>4. Install Antivirus Software</strong></p>
      <p>
        Protect your computer with reliable antivirus software. Regularly update your software to prevent malware, ransomware, and other viruses from infecting your devices.
      </p>

      <p><strong>5. Use Strong Passwords</strong></p>
      <p>
        Protect your online accounts with strong, unique passwords. Consider using a password manager to help generate and store secure passwords for you.
      </p>
