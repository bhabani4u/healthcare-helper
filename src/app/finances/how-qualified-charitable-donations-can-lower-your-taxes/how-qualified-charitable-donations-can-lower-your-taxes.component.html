      How Qualified Charitable Donations Can Lower Your Taxes
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Donating to charity not only helps the community, but it can also significantly reduce your tax bill. Qualified Charitable Donations (QCDs), in particular, offer a smart way to lower taxes, especially for those who are 70½ or older and want to donate directly from their IRA. QCDs allow you to transfer up to $100,000 directly to a qualified charity, avoiding taxes on the amount donated. This is especially beneficial for those required to take Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs).</p>

      <h2>What Are Qualified Charitable Donations (QCDs)?</h2>
      <p>A QCD is a direct transfer of funds from your IRA to a qualified charity. The key benefit is that the distribution doesn’t count as taxable income, making it an excellent option for those taking Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs). If you’re over 70½, you can transfer up to $100,000 each year, satisfying your RMD requirements without increasing your tax liability.</p>

      <h2>Tax Benefits of Charitable Donations</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Tax Deduction: If you itemize deductions on your taxes, charitable contributions can be deducted from your taxable income, reducing your overall tax liability.</li>
        <li>Avoid Capital Gains: Donating appreciated assets like stocks or mutual funds allows you to avoid paying capital gains tax, while still deducting the full market value of the asset.</li>
        <li>Lower Adjusted Gross Income (AGI): When you make a QCD, your AGI is lower, which can result in less of your Social Security being taxed and help you qualify for other deductions and credits.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Action Steps to Maximize Tax Benefits:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use QCDs if You’re 70½ or Older: If you’re required to take RMDs from your IRA, consider a QCD to reduce taxable income while fulfilling your RMD obligations.</li>
        <li>Donate Appreciated Assets: If you hold appreciated stock, consider donating it directly to charity to avoid paying capital gains taxes.</li>
        <li>Track Donations: Ensure that you keep proper records of all donations, including receipts and documentation from the charities, so you can claim them accurately on your tax return.</li>
        <li>Itemize Deductions: If your total deductions, including charitable donations, exceed the standard deduction, itemize your deductions to get the full tax benefit.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Making charitable donations can do more than support the causes you care about—it can also reduce your tax burden. Whether through cash contributions, donating appreciated assets, or making Qualified Charitable Donations (QCDs) directly from your IRA, there are numerous ways to give back while also benefiting financially.</p>
      <p>If you are over 70½ or want to maximize the tax benefits of charitable giving, consult with a tax advisor to incorporate QCDs and other strategies into your financial plan.</p>
