      Annual Financial Planning Checklist: How to Stay Financially Fit Each Year
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Keeping your finances on track is essential for achieving your financial goals, and conducting an annual review can help you put yourself in the best financial position. Here’s a checklist of the most important steps to take each year to stay on top of your financial health.</p>

      <h2>1. Review Your Budget</h2>
      <p>Take time to review your budget at the end of each year. Assess your income, expenses, and savings to determine whether your spending aligns with your financial goals. Make adjustments if needed, and consider setting new savings targets.</p>

      <h2>2. Maximize Retirement Contributions</h2>
      <p>Contribute as much as possible to your retirement accounts, such as a 401(k) or IRA, to take advantage of tax benefits. The 2024 contribution limits are $23,000 for 401(k)s and $7,000 for IRAs (with an additional catch-up contribution for those over 50). Make sure you're on track to maximize these contributions.</p>

      <h2>3. Rebalance Your Investment Portfolio</h2>
      <p>Review your investment portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Markets fluctuate, which may affect your asset allocation. Rebalancing helps keep your investments on track and can reduce risk.</p>

      <h2>4. Check Your Emergency Fund</h2>
      <p>Ensure your emergency fund is sufficient to cover 3-6 months of living expenses. If you've dipped into it during the year, aim to replenish it. Having a robust emergency fund provides peace of mind and protection in case of unexpected expenses.</p>

      <h2>5. Review Insurance Coverage</h2>
      <p>Evaluate your health, home, auto, and life insurance policies. Make sure you have adequate coverage for your needs and that you’re not overpaying for premiums. Consider adjusting coverage if your circumstances have changed, such as getting married, buying a house, or having children.</p>

      <h2>6. Plan for Tax Savings</h2>
      <p>Maximize tax deductions and credits by reviewing your potential tax liability for the year. Consider charitable donations, tax-loss harvesting, and other strategies to reduce your taxable income. Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts like HSAs or 529 plans if eligible.</p>

      <h2>7. Evaluate Debt Repayment Strategies</h2>
      <p>Take stock of your debt, including mortgages, student loans, and credit card balances. Consider whether you can pay off higher-interest debt faster or consolidate debt for a more manageable repayment plan. Reducing debt can significantly improve your financial standing.</p>

      <h2>8. Set Financial Goals for the Next Year</h2>
      <p>Reflect on your financial goals, whether it’s buying a home, saving for a major purchase, or growing your retirement savings. Set measurable, achievable financial goals for the coming year, and outline a plan for how to reach them.</p>

      <h2>9. Review Your Estate Plan</h2>
      <p>Ensure your estate plan is up to date. This includes reviewing your will, beneficiaries, and any powers of attorney. If you've experienced significant life changes, like marriage or the birth of a child, you may need to update these documents.</p>

      <h2>10. Seek Professional Guidance</h2>
      <p>Consider consulting with a financial advisor to review your overall financial strategy. They can provide personalized advice to ensure you’re making the most of your money and navigating complex decisions.</p>

      <p>By reviewing these financial aspects each year, you can ensure that you’re setting yourself up for success and staying financially secure. Small adjustments can make a big difference in helping you reach your financial goals.</p>
