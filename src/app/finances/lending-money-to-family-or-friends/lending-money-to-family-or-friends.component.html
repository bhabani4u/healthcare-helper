      Lending Money to Family or Friends
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Lending money to family or friends may seem like an easy way to help, but it can complicate relationships and lead to unanticipated stress. If you feel compelled to lend money, approach it smartly by setting clear terms and boundaries to protect both parties.</p>

      <h2>1. Treat It Like a Business Transaction</h2>
      <p>Write a formal loan agreement with clear repayment terms, interest rates (if any), and deadlines. This not only formalizes the process but sets clear expectations and reduces misunderstandings.</p>
      <p>Use a loan agreement template and ensure both parties sign it.</p>

      <h2>2. Only Lend What You Can Afford to Lose</h2>
      <p>You must be prepared for the possibility that the money may not be repaid. If this happens, it can create resentment or strain the relationship.</p>
      <p>Only lend an amount that won’t hurt you financially if it's not repaid.</p>

      <h2>3. Set Emotional Boundaries</h2>
      <p>Be prepared for the possibility that repayment may not go as planned, and separate financial matters from emotional ones. If you're comfortable giving a gift instead of a loan, it may reduce the emotional burden on both parties.</p>
      <p>Offer to give part of the money as a gift to lessen the pressure of repayment.</p>

      <h2>4. Explore Alternative Ways to Help</h2>
      <p>Instead of giving money, help your loved one find ways to improve their financial situation. This could include helping them develop a budget, finding a financial advisor, or exploring ways to manage debt.</p>
      <p>Offer financial education resources or direct your loved one to community assistance programs.</p>

      <p>Loaning money to family or friends can complicate even the closest relationships. The best approach is to set clear terms, loan only what you can afford, and explore alternative ways to help.</p>
