      Unique Healthcare Aspects Among Europeans
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>European Americans encompass diverse ethnic backgrounds, yet they share some unique medical and biological traits that healthcare systems need to consider. These differences can influence both the risk of certain diseases and the effectiveness of treatments.</p>

      <h2>1. Skin Cancer Risk</h2>
      <p>People of European descent, especially those with fair skin, have a higher risk of skin cancer due to their lower levels of melanin. Melanin helps protect the skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and individuals with lighter skin are more susceptible to sun damage. Regular skin checks and sun protection are essential for reducing this risk.</p>

      <h2>2. Cardiovascular Disease</h2>
      <p>European Americans, particularly those with a family history of heart disease, tend to have higher risks for cardiovascular issues like high blood pressure, heart attacks, and strokes. This is often linked to both genetic factors and diet, with higher rates of red meat and processed food consumption contributing to these conditions.</p>

      <h2>3. Genetic Conditions</h2>
      <p>Certain genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis (iron overload), are more common among people of European descent. Awareness and early genetic screening can help manage or prevent complications associated with these conditions.</p>

      <h2>4. Autoimmune Diseases</h2>
      <p>Research suggests that Europeans are more prone to autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. While the reasons aren’t fully understood, genetics and environmental triggers may play a role.</p>

      <h2>5. Lactose Tolerance</h2>
      <p>In contrast to other populations, many individuals of Northern European descent have high lactose tolerance due to a genetic mutation that allows them to digest dairy products into adulthood. This is a distinct trait compared to many populations around the world that develop lactose intolerance as they age.</p>

      <p>European Americans face unique healthcare challenges based on genetics and lifestyle factors. By recognizing these traits, healthcare providers can offer personalized care, including regular skin checks, early cardiovascular screening, and genetic counseling when appropriate.</p>
      <p>If you're of European descent, consider regular screenings for skin cancer, heart disease, and genetic conditions that may affect you. A balanced diet, sun protection, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can greatly improve your long-term health.</p>
