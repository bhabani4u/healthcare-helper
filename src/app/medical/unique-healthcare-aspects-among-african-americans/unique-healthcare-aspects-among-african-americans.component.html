      Unique Healthcare Aspects Among African Americans
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>The healthcare needs of African Americans are shaped by specific biological and genetic factors that don’t always align with mainstream American healthcare’s approach. Recognizing these differences can improve outcomes and reduce disparities.</p>

      <h2>1. Disease Risks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Higher Risk of Hypertension:</strong> African Americans are more likely to develop high blood pressure at younger ages, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke.</li>
        <li><strong>Sickle Cell Disease:</strong> Sickle cell anemia disproportionately affects African Americans due to its genetic link to malaria resistance. This condition requires specific screening and management.</li>
        <li><strong>Type 2 Diabetes:</strong> African Americans have a higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, which can lead to complications if not properly managed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Genetic Considerations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lactose Intolerance:</strong> Many African Americans are lactose intolerant due to a genetic predisposition, meaning they may need alternative calcium sources to maintain bone health.</li>
        <li><strong>Vitamin D Deficiency:</strong> Darker skin can reduce the body’s ability to produce vitamin D from sunlight, increasing the risk of deficiency. This can impact bone and immune health.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Tailored Healthcare Approaches</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Screening Adjustments:</strong> Mainstream health guidelines may need modification for African American patients. For example, screening for hypertension and diabetes may need to start earlier.</li>
        <li><strong>Cultural Sensitivity:</strong> Healthcare providers should ensure their treatments and advice are culturally sensitive, considering dietary habits, lifestyle, and the mistrust some African Americans have toward healthcare systems due to historical injustices.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Recognizing and addressing these unique healthcare traits can help African Americans receive more tailored, effective care. A proactive approach, focusing on preventive measures and regular screenings, can lead to better health outcomes for African American patients.</p>
      <p>African American individuals should work with their healthcare providers to ensure early screenings for conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and sickle cell, and consider lifestyle adjustments to mitigate risks.</p>
