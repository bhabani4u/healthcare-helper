      Dealing with Diabetes
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Diabetes is a chronic condition that occurs when the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin or when the body can’t effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. When insulin fails, glucose builds up in the bloodstream, leading to high blood sugar levels.</p>

      <h2>How Modern Lifestyles Contribute to Diabetes</h2>
      <p>Modern diets high in sugar, refined carbohydrates, and unhealthy fats, along with sedentary lifestyles, have contributed to a significant rise in diabetes. Consuming processed foods and sugary drinks puts extra pressure on the pancreas to produce more insulin. Over time, the pancreas may struggle to keep up, leading to insulin resistance or the failure to produce insulin altogether. Coupled with inactivity, this increases the likelihood of developing Type 2 diabetes.</p>

      <h2>A1C Levels and Diabetes Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>The A1C test measures your average blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months. It is used to diagnose diabetes and monitor how well the condition is being managed. Here is a breakdown of A1C levels:</p>

      <table class="table table-bordered">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>A1C Level (%)</th>
            <th>Blood Sugar Control</th>
            <th>Condition</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Below 5.7</td>
            <td>Normal</td>
            <td>No Diabetes</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>5.7 - 6.4</td>
            <td>Prediabetes</td>
            <td>High Risk of Diabetes</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>6.5 and Above</td>
            <td>Diabetes</td>
            <td>Diabetes Diagnosis</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2>Can Diabetes Be Reversed?</h2>
      <p>Type 2 diabetes can sometimes be reversed with significant lifestyle changes, especially in its early stages. Weight loss, a healthy diet, regular exercise, and managing stress levels can improve insulin sensitivity and lower blood sugar levels. However, it’s important to note that Type 1 diabetes cannot be reversed, as it’s an autoimmune condition where the body attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.</p>

      <h2>How to Help Reverse or Manage Diabetes</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Eat a Balanced Diet:</strong> Focus on whole foods, vegetables, lean proteins, and high-fiber grains.</li>
        <li><strong>Exercise Regularly:</strong> Physical activity helps improve insulin sensitivity and reduce blood sugar levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Lose Excess Weight:</strong> Even a modest weight loss can significantly improve insulin sensitivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor Blood Sugar:</strong> Regular monitoring allows for better control and understanding of how different foods and activities affect glucose levels.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Adopting healthier habits like a balanced diet rich in whole foods, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly reduce your risk of diabetes or help manage the condition. Early diagnosis and consistent management are key to improving quality of life.</p>
      <p>If you’re concerned about your blood sugar levels, consult your healthcare provider for an A1C test.</p>
