      Top 10 Retirement Myths
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Retirement planning is crucial, but many people fall victim to misconceptions about Social Security, Medicare, taxes, and cost of living during retirement. Below are the top 10 myths and the truth behind them.</p>

      <p><strong>1. Social Security Will Cover All Your Expenses</strong></p>
      <p>Many believe Social Security benefits are enough to sustain them in retirement, but the reality is that they cover only a portion of living expenses. On average, Social Security replaces about 40% of pre-retirement income, which is typically insufficient to maintain your current lifestyle.</p>

      <p><strong>2. Medicare Will Cover All Healthcare Costs</strong></p>
      <p>A common misunderstanding is that Medicare will cover all healthcare expenses. In reality, it covers only a portion. You will likely need supplemental insurance, and out-of-pocket expenses such as co-pays, premiums, and long-term care aren’t covered by Medicare.</p>

      <p><strong>3. Taxes Won’t Be an Issue in Retirement</strong></p>
      <p>Many retirees think they will pay less in taxes, but depending on your income sources, taxes could still be substantial. Pensions, traditional 401(k)s, and IRAs are often taxed as regular income, and you might also owe taxes on a portion of your Social Security benefits.</p>

      <p><strong>4. I’ll Spend Less During Retirement</strong></p>
      <p>Many retirees anticipate spending less, but costs such as healthcare, travel, and hobbies often increase. Additionally, inflation may erode your purchasing power, so it’s essential to plan for ongoing expenses.</p>

      <p><strong>5. I Don’t Need to Save Until Later</strong></p>
      <p>Procrastination is one of the biggest mistakes people make. Starting to save early allows the power of compound interest to work in your favor, making it easier to build a sufficient retirement nest egg.</p>

      <p><strong>6. I Can Work As Long As I Want</strong></p>
      <p>While working longer can help you save more, health issues or job market changes may force early retirement. It’s important to have contingency plans in place for unforeseen events.</p>

      <p><strong>7. I’ll Only Need 70-80% of My Pre-Retirement Income</strong></p>
      <p>For many retirees, maintaining the same lifestyle post-retirement requires close to 100% of their previous income. Adjusting your budget for increased healthcare costs or pursuing travel and hobbies may require more than anticipated.</p>

      <p><strong>8. Investing in Bonds Is Safer for Retirees</strong></p>
      <p>While bonds are lower risk, they may not offer enough growth to outpace inflation. A well-diversified portfolio that includes a mix of stocks and bonds can help ensure your savings last throughout retirement.</p>

      <p><strong>9. I Don’t Need a Financial Advisor</strong></p>
      <p>Many people believe they can manage their retirement savings on their own, but a financial advisor can help you navigate complex decisions, including taxes, investments, and estate planning, and ensure you're prepared for the long term.</p>

      <p><strong>10. It’s Too Late to Start Saving for Retirement</strong></p>
      <p>Even if you're approaching retirement, it’s never too late to start saving. Consider catch-up contributions to your 401(k) or IRA and maximizing Social Security benefits by delaying withdrawal until full or delayed retirement age.</p>

      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <p>• Plan Early and Diversify: Start saving early, diversify your investments, and ensure you account for healthcare costs and inflation.</p>
      <p>• Consult a Professional: Seek professional advice to tailor your retirement plan to your specific needs and situation.</p>

      <p>By avoiding these myths, you can better prepare for a financially stable and enjoyable retirement.</p>
