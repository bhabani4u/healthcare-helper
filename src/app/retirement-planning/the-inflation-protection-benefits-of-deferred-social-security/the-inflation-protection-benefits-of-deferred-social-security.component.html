      The Inflation Protection Benefits of Deferred Social Security
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>One key benefit of delaying Social Security beyond your full retirement age (FRA) to your delayed retirement age (DRA) is that the monthly benefit increases by up to 8% each year you defer. Furthermore, Social Security benefits are adjusted annually for inflation through the Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLA). This means that if you delay collecting benefits, not only will you receive a higher base amount, but future COLA increases will be applied to this larger amount, providing additional inflation protection.</p>

      <h2>FRA vs. DRA Comparison</h2>
      <p>Let's compare two individuals:</p>
      <p>• Person A collects at their Full Retirement Age (FRA). Their starting monthly benefit is $2,000. With an average COLA increase of 2%, their benefit grows each year, but their starting point remains $2,000.</p>
      <p>• Person B defers until their Delayed Retirement Age (DRA), gaining an additional 8% per year for each year they delay. By deferring, they start with a monthly benefit of $2,640. They also receive the same 2% COLA adjustments, but because they have a higher base, their inflation protection results in a larger absolute increase each year.</p>

      <h2>COLA and Deferred Benefits</h2>
      <p>COLA adjustments can significantly impact your retirement income when you delay benefits. If inflation rises, those with higher deferred benefits see a more substantial increase over time. The combination of delayed benefits and annual inflation adjustments can provide stronger financial security against rising costs in retirement, ensuring that you maintain purchasing power in the years to come.</p>

      <h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>
      <p>• Delaying Social Security until DRA increases your monthly benefit by up to 8% annually.</p>
      <p>• COLA adjustments are applied to the higher deferred benefit, providing better inflation protection.</p>
      <p>• The longer you defer, the more you will benefit from inflation adjustments, ensuring a stronger income in later retirement years.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, deferring Social Security benefits provides significant inflation protection that can greatly enhance financial stability during retirement. Consider the advantages of delaying, especially if you are concerned about inflation eroding your purchasing power over time.</p>
