      Terminology: Trusts
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>A trust is a legal agreement used in estate planning to manage and distribute assets. It involves three main parties:</p>

      <p>• <strong>Grantor:</strong> The person who creates the trust.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Trustee:</strong> The entity or individual who manages the trust's assets.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Beneficiary:</strong> The person or group benefiting from the trust.</p>

      <p>There are two primary types of trusts:</p>
      <p>• <strong>Revocable Trust:</strong> Can be modified or revoked during the grantor's life.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Irrevocable Trust:</strong> Once established, it cannot be changed.</p>

      <p>Different types of irrevocable trusts serve various purposes, such as marital trusts, credit shelter trusts, special needs trusts, dynasty trusts, and more. Each has its specific advantages depending on the grantor’s goals, whether for tax benefits, protecting beneficiaries, or ensuring long-term wealth preservation.</p>
