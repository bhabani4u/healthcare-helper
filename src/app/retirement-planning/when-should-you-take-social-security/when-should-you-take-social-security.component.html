      When Should You Take Social Security?
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Deciding when to take Social Security is a critical financial decision that can significantly impact your retirement income. You can start as early as 62 (Early Retirement Age, ERA), wait until your Full Retirement Age (FRA), or delay benefits until 70 (Delayed Retirement Age, DRA). Each option has its pros and cons, and the decision often hinges on your life expectancy and financial needs.</p>

      <h2>Early Retirement Age (ERA)</h2>
      <p>Starting Social Security benefits at 62 allows you to access income sooner, but it comes with a significant reduction—up to 30%—in the monthly benefit amount compared to waiting until your FRA. This can be a good option for individuals who need the income early due to personal or financial reasons or for those who do not expect to live long enough to benefit from delaying.</p>
      <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
      <p>• You receive benefits sooner.</p>
      <p>• Can help cover costs if you retire early or have no other income.</p>
      <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
      <p>• Reduced monthly benefits for life.</p>
      <p>• May miss out on higher payments from waiting.</p>

      <h2>Full Retirement Age (FRA)</h2>
      <p>The FRA is between 66 and 67, depending on your birth year. This is when you are entitled to your full Social Security benefit. Choosing to wait until your FRA avoids the reduction you’d get by claiming early and provides a balance between earlier access and higher monthly payments.</p>
      <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
      <p>• You receive full benefits.</p>
      <p>• A balanced approach to retirement income planning.</p>
      <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
      <p>• You delay receiving benefits for several years.</p>
      <p>• Missing out on the potential increases by delaying further.</p>

      <h2>Delayed Retirement Age (DRA)</h2>
      <p>Delaying Social Security until age 70 increases your monthly benefit by about 8% each year after your FRA. The break-even point for delaying Social Security is typically around age 80—meaning if you live beyond this point, you come out ahead by waiting. Delaying may be a good option if you have a longer life expectancy and can afford to wait.</p>
      <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
      <p>• Significantly higher monthly benefits.</p>
      <p>• Best option for those who expect to live longer and don’t need immediate income.</p>
      <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
      <p>• You must wait until 70 to start collecting.</p>
      <p>• If you don’t live long enough to pass the break-even point, you might not benefit from the higher payments.</p>

      <h2>The Break-Even Point and Life Expectancy</h2>
      <p>The decision about when to take Social Security often boils down to your life expectancy. The break-even point—the age when the total benefits from delaying begin to exceed the benefits from starting early—is usually around age 80. If you expect to live beyond this age, delaying may make more financial sense.</p>

      <h2>Factors to Consider</h2>
      <p>When deciding when to take Social Security, consider your health, financial situation, and retirement goals. For many, the ideal strategy may involve coordinating Social Security with other retirement income sources, consulting a financial advisor, and thinking carefully about their life expectancy and needs in retirement.</p>
