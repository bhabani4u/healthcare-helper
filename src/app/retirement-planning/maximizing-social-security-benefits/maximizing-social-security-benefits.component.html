      <h2>Spousal and Divorcee Benefits</h2>
      <p>• <strong>Spousal benefits:</strong> You can claim up to 50% of your spouse’s benefit if it’s larger than your own.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Divorcee benefits:</strong> If you were married for at least 10 years, you can claim based on your ex-spouse’s earnings without affecting their benefits.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Survivor benefits:</strong> If your spouse passes away, you can receive their full benefit amount, especially if you wait until full or delayed retirement age.</p>

      <p>Making the right choice depends on your unique circumstances, health, and financial goals. To maximize your Social Security, evaluate all options and consider how your spouse or ex-spouse's benefits may impact your decision.</p>
