      Retiring from Your 401k Before Age 60
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Many people are tempted to tap into their 401k before they turn 60, but doing so can come with significant penalties and drawbacks. Early withdrawal from a 401k is often subject to a 10% penalty on top of regular income taxes, meaning you lose a significant portion of your savings. Additionally, removing funds early diminishes the power of compounding interest, hurting your future financial security.</p>

      <h2>Avoiding Early Withdrawals:</h2>
      <p><strong>1. Penalties:</strong> Early withdrawals are taxed and penalized at 10%.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Lost Growth:</strong> You'll miss out on years of compound growth.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Alternatives:</strong> Consider borrowing or using emergency savings first.</p>
