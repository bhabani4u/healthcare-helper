    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Caring for a parent while planning for your own retirement can be overwhelming. Many people find it difficult to balance caregiving and managing their financial future. However, it’s crucial to not neglect your own retirement needs while being responsible for an elderly loved one.</p>

      <h2>Key Tips for Caregivers:</h2>
      <p><strong>1. Assess Your Parent's Needs:</strong> Understand their health, financial, and long-term care needs to estimate caregiving costs.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Maximize Retirement Contributions:</strong> Make sure to continue contributing to your retirement accounts, especially if your caregiving role limits your income.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Consider Professional Help:</strong> A financial advisor can help you structure a caregiving budget and retirement plan. This is especially useful when there are complex care costs or estate considerations.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Utilize Support Programs:</strong> Research public benefits, such as Medicaid or caregiving support programs, to help alleviate financial strain.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Protect Your Income:</strong> If caregiving limits your ability to work, check if your employer offers flexible working arrangements or benefits that may support your role. You may also want to explore long-term disability insurance to protect your income.</p>
      <p><strong>6. Delegate Tasks:</strong> Don’t hesitate to enlist the help of other family members or professional caregivers. This helps you avoid burnout and ensures you don’t sacrifice your own financial future.</p>
      <p><strong>7. Plan for Long-Term Care:</strong> As you take care of a parent, consider your own future care needs. Consider long-term care insurance to avoid financial strain in the future.</p>

      <p>Balancing caregiving responsibilities with your own financial planning can be challenging, but by preparing wisely and seeking support, you can protect your future while providing the best care for your loved ones.</p>
