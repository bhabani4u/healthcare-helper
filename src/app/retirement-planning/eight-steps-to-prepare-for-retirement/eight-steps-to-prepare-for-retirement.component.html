      <p>Preparing for retirement can feel daunting, especially with the #1 fear of seniors being running out of money. However, by following a few simple steps, you can plan for a financially secure future.</p>

      <p><strong>1. Estimate Your Retirement Needs:</strong> Calculate how much income you'll need to cover expenses, factoring in inflation.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Maximize Retirement Savings:</strong> Take advantage of retirement accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s. Contribute as much as you can and seek employer matching programs.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Create a Budget:</strong> Make a retirement budget that includes basic living expenses, healthcare, and leisure activities.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Plan for Healthcare Costs:</strong> Healthcare can be a major expense in retirement. Consider long-term care insurance and factor Medicare into your budget.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Diversify Investments:</strong> Avoid putting all your assets in one basket. Diversify your investments to help mitigate risk.</p>
      <p><strong>6. Consider Life Insurance:</strong> Life insurance can not only leave a financial legacy for your family but can also pay for things like college education for grandchildren.</p>
      <p><strong>7. Eliminate Debt:</strong> Pay off credit card balances, mortgages, and other debt before retiring to free up your monthly income.</p>
      <p><strong>8. Consult a Financial Advisor:</strong> A professional can help ensure your retirement plan covers all your needs and leaves room for unforeseen circumstances.</p>

      <p>By taking action early and staying proactive with financial planning, you can reduce the fear of running out of money in retirement and enjoy your golden years.</p>
