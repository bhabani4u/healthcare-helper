      When Should You Retire Early?
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Deciding to retire early can be influenced by various health, social, and financial factors. Here are some key considerations:</p>

      <h2>Health:</h2>
      <p>If you're facing health challenges or want to prioritize personal well-being and reduce work-related stress, early retirement may be beneficial. However, assess the costs of healthcare, as Medicare eligibility doesn't start until age 65.</p>

      <h2>Financial Preparedness:</h2>
      <p>Ensure you have sufficient savings to cover decades of retirement. Consider how early withdrawal from retirement accounts might affect your nest egg and taxes. You’ll also want to evaluate other potential income sources such as Social Security, which may be reduced if claimed early.</p>

      <h2>Social and Emotional Readiness:</h2>
      <p>For some, work offers a sense of purpose and social engagement. Ask yourself if you have plans to fill your time with meaningful activities that will keep you mentally and emotionally engaged.</p>

      <p>Retiring early may be the right choice under specific circumstances, but it requires careful planning. Speak to a financial planner, explore your health situation, and assess your goals for a fulfilling retirement.</p>
