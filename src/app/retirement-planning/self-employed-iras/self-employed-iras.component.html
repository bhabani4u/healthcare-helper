      <p>If you are a business owner or self-employed, setting up a SEP IRA (Simplified Employee Pension Individual Retirement Arrangement) can be an excellent retirement savings option. A SEP IRA allows you to contribute larger amounts than traditional IRAs, with contributions of up to 25% of your net earnings from self-employment or $66,000 for 2023—whichever is less.</p>

      <h2>Why Choose a SEP IRA?</h2>
      <p><strong>1. Higher Contribution Limits:</strong> SEP IRAs allow significantly larger contributions compared to traditional or Roth IRAs, making it ideal for business owners with fluctuating income.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Tax Benefits:</strong> Contributions are tax-deductible, and investment earnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawn during retirement, allowing your savings to compound over time.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Simplicity:</strong> SEP IRAs are easy to set up and maintain, with fewer administrative hassles compared to other retirement plans, making them ideal for small business owners.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Flexibility:</strong> Unlike some other plans, SEP IRAs allow for flexibility in contributions, meaning you don’t have to contribute every year, and the amount can vary depending on your financial situation.</p>
      <p><strong>5. No Catch-Up Contributions:</strong> Unlike traditional or Roth IRAs, SEP IRAs do not offer additional catch-up contributions for individuals over 50.</p>

      <h2>Steps to Set Up a SEP IRA:</h2>
      <p><strong>1. Choose a Financial Institution:</strong> Find a bank or brokerage firm that offers SEP IRA accounts.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Create a Formal Agreement:</strong> You must complete IRS Form 5305-SEP or establish a plan through a financial institution.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Contribute:</strong> Make your tax-deductible contributions by the tax filing deadline.</p>
