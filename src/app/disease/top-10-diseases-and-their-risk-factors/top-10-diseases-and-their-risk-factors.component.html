      Top 10 Diseases & Their Risk Factors
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Living carefree is a wonderful ideal, but it is not good for your health! It means that we may develop blinders that prevent us from seeing signs of illness until it gets too late. The United States faces a variety of common diseases that significantly impact public health and well-being. From heart disease to diabetes, these conditions are often preventable or manageable through lifestyle changes and early intervention. Below, we explore the top ten most common diseases, their risk factors, and simple actions individuals can take to address them.</p>

      <h2>1. Heart Disease</h2>
      <p>Heart disease is a range of conditions affecting the heart, including coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, and heart defects. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., primarily driven by conditions such as coronary artery disease. Risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, and smoking.</p>
      <p><strong>How to Address It:</strong> Adopt a heart-healthy diet, exercise regularly, and avoid smoking. Regular check-ups can also help manage cholesterol and blood pressure levels.</p>

      <h2>2. Cancer</h2>
      <p>In a normally functioning body, old cells are regularly dying out and new cells develop to take their place. Cancer is a blanket term that describes cells that grow and multiply uncontrollably, creating issues within the body. Cancers can affect our blood, or can develop into solid masses, known as tumors. In both cases, cancer can spread to other parts of the body.</p>
      <p>Various types of cancer, such as lung, breast, and colorectal cancer, rank as leading causes of death. Risk factors include smoking, excessive alcohol use, poor diet, and family history.</p>
      <p><strong>How to Address It:</strong> Routine screenings (such as mammograms and colonoscopies), quitting smoking, reducing alcohol consumption, and maintaining a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables are crucial preventive measures.</p>

      <h2>3. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</h2>
      <p>COPD is a chronic lung condition that makes it difficult to breathe. It includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis, often caused by long-term exposure to irritating gases or cigarette smoke. It is primarily caused by long-term exposure to cigarette smoke and environmental pollutants. The condition leads to breathing difficulties and chronic lung damage.</p>
      <p><strong>How to Address It:</strong> Quit smoking and avoid exposure to pollutants. Pulmonary rehabilitation exercises and medications can improve lung function.</p>

      <h2>4. Stroke</h2>
      <p>A stroke is a medical condition where poor blood flow to the brain results in cell death. It can occur due to a blockage (ischemic stroke) or bleeding (hemorrhagic stroke) in the brain.  Strokes occur when the brain’s blood supply is interrupted, usually due to a blood clot or bleeding. Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, and an unhealthy diet.</p>
      <p><strong>How to Address It:</strong> Control blood pressure, maintain a healthy weight, exercise, and eat a balanced diet. Quitting smoking and limiting alcohol can reduce the risk of stroke.</p>

      <h2>5. Alzheimer’s Disease</h2>
      <p>Alzheimer’s disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, is the most common cause of dementia. It affects memory, thinking, and behavior. Risk factors include age, genetics, and possibly poor cardiovascular health.</p>
      <p><strong>How to Address It:</strong> While no cure exists, staying mentally and physically active, maintaining social connections, and managing cardiovascular health may help delay its onset.</p>

      <h2>6. Diabetes (Type 2)</h2>
      <p>Diabetes is chronic condition that affects how the body processes blood sugar (glucose). Type 2 diabetes is characterized by the body’s inability to use insulin properly, leading to high blood sugar. Risk factors include obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and poor diet.</p>
      <p><strong>How to Address It:</strong> Manage weight through regular physical activity and a healthy diet. Regular blood sugar monitoring and medication, if needed, can prevent complications.</p>

      <h2>7. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)</h2>
      <p>CKD describes a gradual loss of kidney function over time, which can progress to kidney failure and require dialysis or a transplant. It often develops as a result of diabetes and high blood pressure. This gradual loss means that the kidneys are unable to process waste in our blood stream, such as cleaning out dead blood cells, resulting in waste in our bodies getting backed up. A gradual loss of kidney function can progress to kidney failure if untreated.</p>
      <p><strong>How to Address It:</strong> Manage blood pressure and blood sugar, avoid excessive use of medications that can harm the kidneys, and stay hydrated.</p>

      <h2>8. Influenza (Flu)</h2>
      <p>The flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses, affecting millions annually. It can cause mild to severe illness and, in some cases, lead to death. Risk factors include age (very young and elderly), chronic conditions, and weak immunity.</p>
      <p><strong>How to Address It:</strong> Get an annual flu vaccine, practice good hygiene, and stay home when sick to prevent spreading the virus.</p>

      <h2>9. Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)</h2>
      <p>Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a condition where the force of the blood against the artery walls is too high, increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. It is a significant risk factor for heart disease and stroke. It is often dubbed the "silent killer" because symptoms are not always noticeable.</p>
      <p><strong>How to Address It:</strong> Adopt a low-sodium diet, exercise regularly, manage stress, and monitor blood pressure regularly.</p>

      <h2>10. Arthritis</h2>
      <p>Arthritis is a term describing Inflammation of the joints, causing pain, swelling, and reduced motion. It causes pain and stiffness in the joints, particularly osteoarthritis, which occurs due to wear and tear over time. Risk factors include aging, joint injuries, and obesity.</p>
      <p><strong>How to Address It:</strong> Regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and managing inflammation through medication can alleviate symptoms.</p>

      <p>While these common diseases can be life-threatening, many are preventable or manageable through lifestyle changes. Regular physical activity, a balanced diet, avoiding harmful habits like smoking, and staying proactive with medical screenings are key steps toward reducing the risk of these diseases. By taking small, consistent actions, individuals can lead healthier lives and significantly improve their chances of avoiding serious health conditions.</p>
