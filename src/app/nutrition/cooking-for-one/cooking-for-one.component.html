      Cooking for One: Quick and Healthy Meals Without Waste
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Cooking for one or two can sometimes feel daunting, especially when trying to avoid waste. When you’re only cooking for one or two, it’s easy to fall into a food rut and wonder if it’s even worth the extra effort. But don’t sell yourself short! Home cooking—no matter the size of your household—is important and many times, the best way to nourish your body with healthy foods. With a few strategies, you can create quick and healthy meals while keeping ingredients fresh and limiting leftovers. Here are a few tips:</p>

      <p>Planning meals ahead helps make healthy cooking a priority. Once a week—prior to your weekly grocery shopping trip—take time to plan and write down a week’s worth of meals. Then, use your meal plan to create your grocery list. Keep your meal plan out in the open so that you can be reminded of it often.</p>

      <p>Choosing dishes that serve as whole meals can be fast and easy. Plus, using just one dish often means less prep and cleanup. Soups, stews and casseroles make great one-dish or one-pot meals. But use caution: They aren’t always made with healthy ingredients, so you may need to do a recipe re-do. You will likely have leftovers from these types of dishes unless you reduce the recipe and use a smaller dish. One-dish meals should incorporate several food groups including lean meats, whole grains, vegetables and legumes. Examples of healthy one-dish meals include: lean beef, barley and vegetables stew; chicken, vegetable and brown rice casserole; vegetarian chili; and vegetable lasagna</p>

      <p>Do you live in a community with other people? Do you have friends in a similar situation? If so, a meal swap or dinner party may help. To do a meal swap, follow these steps:</p>
      <p>• Partner with your friend to find two recipes that you’d both enjoy that serve 2–4 (depending on your current household size) and can be frozen and enjoyed later.</p>
      <p>• Bring the recipes to life. Make the recipes according to the instructions, or make them healthier!</p>
      <p>• Keep 1–2 servings for yourself, package the rest and give it to your friend, and vice-versa. If you enjoy entertaining and cooking for large groups, consider hosting a weekly dinner party.</p>

      <p>One of the biggest challenges when cooking for one or two may be finding motivation and inspiration. These tips may help make cooking for one more fun:</p>
      <p>• Mix things up. Don’t get stuck in a food rut. If you find yourself eating the same meals day after day, challenge yourself and make goals to experiment more in the kitchen.</p>
      <p>• Share with others. If you’re finding the act of cooking and eating solo to be lonely, try to find ways to share with others (e.g. invite a friend over, cook for a neighbor, set a weekly at-home dinner date).</p>
      <p>• Think outside the box. You don’t always have to stick with traditional meals. If you’re short on time or energy, a nutritious snack can be subbed in for a meal.</p>
      <p>• Focus on fueling your body with the best foods. Healthy eating, along with the right amount of physical activity, sleep and socialization, helps keep you feeling your best.</p>

      <p>With a little planning and smart shopping, you can make delicious, nutritious meals without worrying about food waste!</p>
