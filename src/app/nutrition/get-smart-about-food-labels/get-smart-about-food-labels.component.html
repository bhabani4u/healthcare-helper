    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>When you pick up a package of food at the store, it’s easy to be drawn in by claims like "low fat" or "organic." But what are food labels really telling you? Understanding how to read and interpret labels can help you make smarter choices for your health.</p>

      <p>Food labels may help you make healthier choices. They give you information about calories, number of servings and the nutrients in the foods you eat and the beverages you drink.</p>
      <p>It all starts with the label. Good nutrition is important throughout your entire life. It may help you feel good, stay strong and reduce the risk of some diseases, or manage your symptoms if you alreadyhave certain issues.1 If you want to know what’s in the foods you eat, you have to read the label! Reading food labels may help youget more of the nutrients you want and avoid the ones you don’t need.</p>
      <p>However, some parts of the food label are undergoing changes. Learning about these changeswill help empower you to make healthy choices.</p>
      <p>Changes to the label. In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began updating the Nutrition Facts label. The foodlabel features a fresh design that may help make it easier for you to make informed and healthyfood choices.</p>

      <p>The new food label has four main parts:</p>
      <p>• The serving size and servings per container</p>
      <p>• The amount of calories</p>
      <p>• A breakdown of nutrients – fats, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates and protein</p>
      <p>• A breakdown of beneficial vitamins and minerals – vitamin D, calcium, iron and potassium</p>

      <h2>The Key Elements of Food Labels:</h2>
      <p>1. Serving Size: Always check this first. The serving size can often be misleading, making the nutritional facts seem healthier than they really are. If you eat more than one serving, you’re consuming more calories, fat, and sugar than the label may suggest.</p>
      <p>2. Calories: This indicates how much energy you’ll get from a serving of the food. Be mindful if you're managing your weight.</p>
      <p>3. Total Fat: This section breaks down into different types of fats—saturated, trans, and unsaturated. Saturated and trans fats should be limited, while unsaturated fats are considered healthier.</p>
      <p>4. Sodium: Many processed foods contain high levels of sodium. Check this section if you're watching your salt intake.</p>
      <p>5. Sugars: Look for added sugars on the label. Foods with high amounts of added sugar can lead to weight gain and other health issues.</p>
      <p>6. Ingredients List: Ingredients are listed in descending order by weight. If sugar or other unhealthy ingredients appear near the top of the list, the food may not be as healthy as it seems.</p>
      <p>7. Percent Daily Value (%DV): This tells you how much of your daily recommended intake of a nutrient one serving provides. A 5% DV or less is considered low, while 20% DV or more is considered high.</p>

      <h2>Common Labeling Tricks:</h2>
      <p>• "Low Fat" or "Fat-Free": These claims don’t necessarily mean the food is healthy. Often, when fat is removed, extra sugar is added for taste.</p>
      <p>• "Natural": This term isn’t well regulated. It doesn’t guarantee the food is free from chemicals or processed ingredients.</p>
      <p>• "Organic": Organic foods are grown without synthetic pesticides or fertilizers, but that doesn’t always make them healthier in terms of calories, fats, or sugar content.</p>

      <h2>Actionable Tips:</h2>
      <p>• Always read the full label, not just the claims on the front.</p>
      <p>• Compare products to choose lower-sodium, lower-sugar, and lower-saturated-fat options.</p>
      <p>• Be wary of foods that seem "healthy" but are loaded with hidden ingredients like added sugars or sodium.</p>

      <p>Food labels are packed with information that can help you make better nutritional choices, but they can also be confusing. The more you understand about what you’re reading, the easier it will be to stay on track with your health goals. Take the time to scan labels, understand what each section means, and make informed decisions for a healthier lifestyle.</p>
