      Banned in Europe, But Not in the US?
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Food additives like Red 40 and potassium bromate, which are approved by the FDA in the US, are banned in Europe due to concerns about their potential effects on health, particularly in children. Red 40 is a synthetic dye found in many snacks and drinks, linked to hyperactivity in children and behavioral issues. Potassium bromate, often used to enhance bread, is classified as a possible carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.</p>

      <h2>Why Are They Banned in Europe?</h2>
      <p>1. Red 40 (Allura Red AC): In Europe, food dyes like Red 40 must carry warning labels due to studies linking them to hyperactivity in children. European regulators take a more precautionary stance, limiting or banning synthetic dyes from food products.</p>
      <p>2. Potassium Bromate: This chemical, added to bread dough to improve elasticity, is banned in the EU and several other countries because studies have shown that it can be carcinogenic in animals. While the FDA allows its use in small amounts, the EU maintains stricter regulations.</p>

      <h2>Impact on Child Development, Brain Function, and Metabolism</h2>
      <p>• Red 40 and Hyperactivity: Research suggests that synthetic dyes like Red 40 may worsen ADHD symptoms and behavioral issues in children.</p>
      <p>• Potassium Bromate and Cancer Risk: Potassium bromate is associated with increased cancer risks, particularly related to thyroid and kidney function.</p>
      <p>• Metabolic Disruption: Some additives have been linked to changes in metabolism, contributing to obesity and insulin resistance, though more studies are needed for conclusive results.</p>

      <h2>How to Avoid These Additives</h2>
      <p>• Read Labels: Check ingredient lists for dyes like Red 40 and preservatives like potassium bromate.</p>
      <p>• Opt for Whole Foods: Processed foods are more likely to contain synthetic additives. Choosing whole, unprocessed options can help minimize exposure.</p>
      <p>• Choose European Products: If you want to avoid certain additives, consider purchasing products that adhere to European food regulations, which have stricter bans on certain substances.</p>

      <p>While these additives are allowed in the US, awareness of their potential risks, particularly for children and long-term health, may guide consumers toward healthier food choices.</p>
