      Good Foods for Your Gut
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Your digestive system is essential for overall well-being, and what you eat plays a significant role in how it functions. While some foods can promote gut health, others can cause issues like bloating, gas, or discomfort.</p>

      <p>The right kinds of foods can help your digestive system. Your body gets nutrients (proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals and water) from food and liquids. Then, your digestive system breaks down these nutrients into parts small enough for your body to absorb and use for energy, growth, and cell repair.1</p>

      <h2>How digestion works</h2>
      <p>Digestion is a complicated process that involves your nerves, hormones, bacteria, blood and the organs of your digestive system.</p>

      <p>1. Mouth Saliva is produced to moisten food and begin breakdown</p>
      <p>2. Liver Makes bile to digest fats and some vitamins</p>
      <p>3. Gallbladder Stores bile between meals and squeezes it into small intestines</p>
      <p>4. Small intestine Makes digestive juices to complete breakdown of food, absorbs water and other nutrients</p>

      <p>5. Esophagus Muscles work to push food down into the stomach</p>
      <p>6. Stomach Food is mixed with digestive juices to break it down more</p>
      <p>7. Pancreas Makes a digestive juice that breaks down carbs, fats and proteins</p>
      <p>8. Large intestine Bacteria breaks down remaining nutrients and waste becomes stool</p>

      <p>Here's how to keep your digestion running smoothly by making smart food choices:</p>

      <h2>Gut-friendly foods</h2>
      <p>The eight foods below may offer benefits for your digestive system</p>

      <p>These foods can improve digestion and overall gut health, but special considerations should be made for individual conditions like IBS, celiac disease, and others. Incorporating these foods into your diet can promote better digestion and well-being.</p>

      <h2>Unfriendly foods for digestion</h2>
      <p>Some foods can contribute to digestive problems.</p>

      <p><strong>Fried foods</strong></p>
      <p>Fatty, fried foods may cause diarrhea or constipation; low fiber and high fat content make them hard to digest.</p>

      <p><strong>Spicy foods</strong></p>
      <p>These may irritate the esophagus and cause heartburn.</p>

      <p><strong>Alcohol</strong></p>
      <p>Alcoholic beverages may relax the esophageal sphincter, causing heartburn. They may also cause inflammation in the stomach lining, preventing the absorption of nutrients.</p>

      <p><strong>Caffeine</strong></p>
      <p>Food and drinks with caffeine make things move through your digestive system too quickly, causing diarrhea. They can also be a trigger for people with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).</p>

      <p><strong>Dairy products</strong></p>
      <p>Dairy products may be difficult to digest for those with lactose intolerance. They may cause diarrhea, gas and bloating</p>

      <h2>Take Simple Steps to Boost Gut Health:</h2>
      <p>• <strong>Eat slowly:</strong> Chewing food thoroughly allows for better digestion.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Stay active:</strong> Regular exercise promotes a healthy digestive system.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Consider probiotics:</strong> Probiotic supplements can help balance your gut bacteria.</p>

      <p>By incorporating more gut-friendly foods and avoiding those that commonly cause trouble, you can keep your digestive system happy and running smoothly. A healthy gut leads to overall well-being, so make small changes and notice how much better you feel!</p>
