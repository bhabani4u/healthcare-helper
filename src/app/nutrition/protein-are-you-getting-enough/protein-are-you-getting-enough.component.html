      Protein: Are You Getting Enough?
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Protein is essential for building muscles, repairing tissues, and supporting overall health. But how do you know if you're getting enough? Proteins are the building blocks of your cells. What’s a building block? It forms the structure necessary to create a cell. Proteins contain carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. They are the same thing as Amino Acids. Some amino acids MUST come from food.</p>

      <p>Here are different sources of proteins:</p>
      <p>• Complete Proteins: meat, dairy, poultry, and eggs</p>
      <p>• Incomplete Proteins: plant foods like beans, peas, grains, nuts, seeds and vegetables</p>
      <p>• Complementary Proteins form complete proteins when eaten together, like grains and legumes, or rice and beans</p>

      <p>Most adults need around 46–56 grams of protein daily, depending on their age, weight, and activity level. Signs that you might not be getting enough protein include fatigue, muscle loss, and slow healing.</p>

      <p>Vegetarian options have gotten incredibly better and better over the years. Today, plant-based options exist that are almost impossible to detect from animal proteins.</p>

      <p>We are developing greater consciousness of our planet – it exists for future generations. Becoming sustainable means doing things that are long-lasting. Can we live on a planet with 10 billion people and with a limited water supply? Yes. But we must do our part. Cows take up a tremendous amount of water in the form of grains and grasses they eat. So while advocating for a fully vegetarian diet may be one of many options to consider, what’s important is that we develop our consciousness of the importance of preserving our planet.</p>

      <h2>Quick Tips:</h2>
      <p>• Include a source of protein with every meal.</p>
      <p>• Mix plant-based proteins like beans or lentils into your diet.</p>
      <p>• Monitor your portion sizes to avoid overeating.</p>

      <p>Getting enough protein helps maintain muscle mass, keeps you energized, and supports your overall health.</p>
