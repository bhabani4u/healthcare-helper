      Eating Healthy When Eating Out
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Eating out is a great treat, but many restaurants design dishes to be as delicious and indulgent as possible—sometimes at the cost of health. Restaurants often add extra salt, fat, and sugar to keep you coming back, so it's important to create boundaries to protect your health.</p>

      <p>According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, since the 1970s, the number of fast food restaurants has more than doubled—and so has the rate of obesity. In addition, the average number of calories consumed per day has increased by 600. The bottom line: It can be hard to follow a healthy diet when you’re dining out, but that doesn’t mean you have to avoid it entirely.</p>

      <h2>General Tips:</h2>

      <p>o Portion Control: Restaurant portions are often larger than needed. Consider sharing dishes or packing half to-go.</p>
      <p>o Watch the Extras: Be mindful of added sauces, cheeses, and sides. Ask for these on the side or in smaller portions.</p>
      <p>o Hydrate Smartly: Opt for water, unsweetened tea, or sparkling water instead of sugary drinks.</p>

      <h2>Healthy Swaps to Try:</h2>
      <p>• Request sauces and dressings on the side and/or that your meal be prepared with less oil, butter or salt.</p>
      <p>• Stick with a side salad, a plain baked potato, roasted veggies or fresh fruit.</p>
      <p>• Stick to water to drink.</p>
      <p>• Split your meal with someone else, or save half for later.</p>
      <p>• Don’t supersize your meal, no matter how good of a deal it is.</p>
      <p>• Avoid buffets—they make it too easy to overeat.</p>
      <p>• Look at the menu ahead of time to find nutrition information for various dishes.</p>
      <p>• Don’t be fooled by “healthy” dishes—some are calorie minefields.</p>
      <p>• Ask about an alternative menu with smaller portions.</p>

      <h2>Take Action:</h2>
      <p>With a few smart choices, you can enjoy your favorite restaurants while keeping your health in check.
