      <p>Building a healthy plate doesn’t have to be hard, and making a few simple changes can take your meals from fair to five-star quality. But first, what are the values of the foods we want to add to our plates?</p>

      <h2>Fruit</h2>
      <p>They’re also a good source of nutrients that most of us don’t get enough of. 76 percent of Americans do not eat enough fruits each day</p>
      <p>• Potassium reduces blood pressure, kidney stones, bone loss</p>
      <p>• vitamin C grows and repairs body tissues, helps heal cuts and wounds and keeps teeth and gums healthy</p>
      <p>• folate (folic acid) helps in the formation of red blood cells.</p>
      <p>• Reduce the risk of heart disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancers.</p>
      <p>The daily recommendation for fruit for women over the age of 51 is 1½ cups; for men, it’s 2 cups.  Some tips to help you get that intake are:</p>
      <p>• Make one-quarter of your plate fruit at every meal.</p>
      <p>• Have fruit as a snack or as dessert.</p>
      <p>• Colors! Various fruits differ in nutrient content so aim for a variety of colors.</p>

      <h2>Vegetables</h2>
      <p>They’re naturally low in fat, sodium, calories and are cholesterol-free. 87 percent of Americans do not eat enough vegetables</p>
      <p>Same nutrients as fruit. But also high in vitamin A.</p>
      <p>• Vitamin A helps keep your eyes and skin healthy and also helps protect from infections.</p>
      <p>• Fiber reduces cholesterol for heart and blood vessels healthy and cleans intestines.</p>
      <p>• Reduces your risk of heart disease, protect against certain types of cancer, and prevent obesity, according to the USDA.</p>
      <p>It’s recommended that women over 51 eat 2 cups of vegetables per day and men should eat 2½ cups.  Some tips for consuming that amount include:</p>
      <p>• Choose fresh vegetables in season</p>
      <p>• Buy easy-to-prepare vegetables, like pre-washed salad kits or packages of veggie snacks, like baby carrots or celery sticks for a quick snack.</p>
      <p>• Variety of color</p>
      <p>• Watch what you’re adding to your vegetables.   If you’re adding a lot of butter and a lot of salt, you may actually be “undoing” the benefits of the vegetable</p>

      <h2>Grains</h2>
      <p>Refined grains are not good. White rice, bread, pasta, cereal. Refined grains may increase your risk of weight gain, overeating, heart disease, and diabetes.</p>
      <p>Whole grains: cracked wheat, oatmeal, cornmeal and brown rice.  Whole grains, digest slowly. maintain insulin and blood sugar levels, help you feel full longer, prevent weight gain, and ward off disease.</p>
      <p>Women over age 51 should eat 5 ounces of grains per day and men should eat 6 ounces.  At least half of those grains should be whole grains (so regardless of whether you are male or female, at least 3 ounces of your grains should be whole grains. 1 slice of bread, 1 cup of ready-to-eat cereal, or ½ cup of  cooked rice, pasta or cooked cereal is considered one ounce.)</p>
      <p>Some other tips to help you get your daily recommendation for grains include:</p>
      <p>Choose grain products like cereals, breads, rice and pasta that are 100% whole grain instead of refined grains. Also, popcorn is a whole-grain and can be a healthy snack if made with little or no added salt and butter.</p>

      <h2>Protein</h2>
      <p>Women over the age of 51 should have 5 ounces of protein per day while men over the age of 51 should have 5 ½ ounces. In general, 1 ounce of meat, poultry or fish, ¼ cup cooked beans, 1 egg, 1 tablespoon of peanut butter, or ½ ounce of nuts or seeds can be considered as 1 ounce.</p>
      <p>When choosing proteins, there are a few things to keep in mind:</p>
      <p>• Some choices from the protein group are high in saturated fat; diets that are high in saturated fat raise LDL levels (the “bad” cholesterol).  Some examples of these are fatty cuts of beef, pork and lamb; 75% - 85% ground beef, sausage, hot dogs and bacon.</p>
      <p>• Choosing small portions of lean protein Eat fish or other seafood.  Eating a variety of seafood can help prevent heart disease, the number one killer in men and women in the United States.</p>
      <p>• Remember, meat isn’t the only source of protein.  Eggs, beans and peas, nuts and nut butters, tofu and tempeh can provide protein, too.</p>

      <h2>Dairy</h2>
      <p>Dairy yogurt, milk helps reduce reduces heart disease and Type-2 Diabetes.</p>
      <p>These foods (and drinks) are typically rich in calcium.  Calcium helps in building teeth, building bones and maintaining bone mass.  Vitamin D, which is found in many dairy products, helps the body maintain proper levels of calcium and phosphorous, helping with bone health and lowering the risk of osteoporosis.</p>
      <p>Both men and women over the age of 51 should have 3 cups of dairy per day.</p>
      <p>Human society went through big changes when we went from nomadic tribes to sedentary agricultural societies. We began to eat a lot more carbohydrates. This is where a lot of our modern health issues began. Diabetes was not a problem until we master the art of harvesting sugar and storing it for long-term use.</p>

      <h2>Tips for shopping</h2>
      <p>• Avoid shopping hungry. When you’re hungry, you’ll want to buy all of the tasty, convenient junk food you see.</p>
      <p>• Make your grocery list in advance. Grocery store is literally designed for you to buy!</p>
