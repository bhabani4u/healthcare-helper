      The Truth About Carbs
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Carbohydrates are an essential part of a healthy diet, but not all carbs are created equally. The key is to know which carbs to prioritize and which ones to limit.</p>

      <p>Carbohydrates are a complex form of energy, which our body breaks down into sugars, which then enters our bloodstream to provide us with energy. The issue with carbohydrates is the rate at which sugar enters our bloodstream.</p>

      <p>Throughout human history, accumulating and storing a reliable energy supply was extremely hard to come by. Energy supplies were generally from complex carbohydrates, which we know today as whole grains, fruits, legumes and vegetables. These foods would be broken down over time, resulting in a slow but steady stream of sugars entering our bloodstream and providing us with energy.</p>

      <p>The slave trade during the 1600s and beyond brought many African slaves to places such as Cuba and Brazil, where large plantations were built solely to grow and harvest labor-intensive sugar cane. Simple sugars that came from sugar cane were not easy to come by, and would rot or ferment, until refrigeration techniques were invented, which allowed us to store simple sugars in large capacities. For the first time in history, we now had a surplus of energy that we could deploy on command. Food recipes began using sugar in ever larger amounts during the past century, and we began developing first world health problems such as diabetes – the sugar disease.</p>

      <p>How does simple sugar differ from complex carbohydrates which break down into sugars? The difference is that complex carbohydrates take much longers to enter our bloodstream, whereas simple sugars enter immediately, and all at once. When sugars enter our bloodstream, our pancrease produces insulin in order to regulate our sugar intake. A lot of sugar creates insulin spikes, which then draw out as much sugar from our blood as possible, storing it as fat for future use.</p>

      <p>In diabetics, the system breaks down and we are unable to produce enough insulin to manage our sugar levels, creating serious health issues. Diabetes can be prevented, or managed, if we develop healthy habits when it comes to carbs.</p>

      <h2>Healthy Carbs:</h2>
      <p>• <strong>Whole Grains:</strong> Brown rice, quinoa, oats, and whole-wheat products provide fiber, vitamins, and long-lasting energy.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Vegetables:</strong> Non-starchy vegetables like leafy greens are rich in nutrients and low in calories.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Fruits:</strong> Fresh fruits are packed with vitamins, minerals, and natural sugars.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Legumes:</strong> Beans, lentils, and peas offer both fiber and protein.</p>

      <h2>Carbs to Limit:</h2>
      <p>• <strong>Refined Carbs:</strong> These include white bread, pastries, and sugary snacks, which can spike blood sugar and offer little nutritional value.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Sugary Beverages:</strong> Sodas and sugary drinks provide empty calories and should be consumed sparingly.</p>

      <p>Take care of your body. Limit your sugar intake!</p>
