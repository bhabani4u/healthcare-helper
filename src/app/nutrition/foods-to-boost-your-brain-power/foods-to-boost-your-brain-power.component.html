      Foods to Boost Your Brain Power
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Even in healthy people, the brain and body slow down and become less flexible with age. It isn’t uncommon to experience the following changes:</p>
      <p>• Age-related memory loss</p>
      <p>• Slower processing speed</p>
      <p>• Speed of learning decreases</p>

      <p>Occasionally, people experience more serious brain changes. One example of this is dementia. Dementia includes memory loss and difficulties with thinking, problem solving and language.</p>

      <p>Your diet plays a crucial role in maintaining brain health and keeping your mind sharp. Certain foods contain nutrients that support cognitive function, improve memory, and even reduce the risk of age-related mental decline. Research indicates that following the Mediterranean diet may help keep the brain healthy and prevent dementia.</p>
