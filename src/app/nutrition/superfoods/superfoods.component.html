      <p>There is no single food or nutrient that will keep your body disease-free. However, a healthy diet filled with the right variety of foods may offer some protection.</p>

      <h2>What is a superfood?</h2>
      <p>Superfoods are nutrient-rich foods considered to be beneficial for health and well-being. The term “superfood” has no concrete definition, but superfoods are usually rich in antioxidants.</p>

      <p>According to the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, antioxidants are nutrients that protect and repair cells from damage caused by free radicals. Free radicals are chemicals that have the potential to harm the body’s cells. The damage they cause may play a role in the development of cancer and other health conditions.</p>

      <p>According to the National Cancer Institute, antioxidants neutralize free radicals to help prevent cell damage. The body makes some antioxidants, but it relies on other sources— mainly the diet—to get the rest it needs.</p>

      <h2>Disease Prevention and Management</h2>
      <p>Superfoods can be especially helpful in managing conditions like high cholesterol, diabetes, and hypertension. For example, walnuts and almonds, rich in healthy fats, may help reduce cholesterol. Similarly, whole grains like oats are good for heart health, and beans are an excellent source of plant-based protein that can help regulate blood sugar.</p>

      <h2>Making Superfoods Work for You</h2>
      <p>While there’s no one-size-fits-all approach, consider adding a few superfoods to your daily meals. Start small—maybe a handful of nuts or adding leafy greens to your salad. Consult with your doctor to understand which superfoods are best suited for managing your specific health needs.</p>

      <p>Superfoods can be a great addition to your diet, offering vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that support overall well-being. While they won't replace traditional treatments, they can certainly complement a balanced diet, leading to better health outcomes.</p>
