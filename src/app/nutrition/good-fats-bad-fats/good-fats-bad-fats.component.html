      Good Fats, Bad Fats
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Dietary fat sometimes gets a bad rap, but it’s an important nutrient your body needs to function well. Dietary fat is a macronutrient that helps make up your food, along with carbohydrates and protein. Your body needs some dietary fat, but not too much. But there are different types of fat, and it’s important to understand which types of fats are good for your health, and which may be problematic. While some are harmful, others are essential for good health. Understanding which fats to avoid and which to embrace can help you make better choices for your heart and overall wellness.</p>

      <h2>Fats have lots of important functions in the body, including:1</h2>
      <p>• Serve as fuel to give your body energy</p>
      <p>• Help the body absorb certain vitamins</p>
      <p>• Produce important hormones</p>
      <p>• Help people feel full</p>
      <p>• Give foods flavor and texture</p>

      <h2>Bad Fats:</h2>
      <p>1. <strong>Trans Fats:</strong> These are the worst type of fats for your health. Found in processed snacks, baked goods, and margarine, trans fats raise bad cholesterol (LDL) and lower good cholesterol (HDL), increasing your risk of heart disease. The FDA has banned artificial trans fats, but some products may still contain small amounts. Always check food labels for "partially hydrogenated oils," which signal the presence of trans fats.</p>
      <p>2. <strong>Saturated Fats:</strong> These fats are found in animal products like butter, cheese, and fatty cuts of meat. While not as harmful as trans fats, saturated fats can still raise LDL cholesterol. It's best to limit these fats to no more than 10% of your daily caloric intake.</p>

      <h2>Good Fats:</h2>
      <p>1. <strong>Monounsaturated Fats:</strong> These healthy fats can help reduce bad cholesterol and lower your risk of heart disease. Found in olive oil, avocados, and nuts like almonds and peanuts, monounsaturated fats are a great addition to your diet. Cooking with olive oil instead of butter is a simple swap that can benefit your heart.</p>
      <p>2. <strong>Polyunsaturated Fats:</strong> These include omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which are essential for brain function and cell growth. Omega-3 fats, in particular, are known to reduce inflammation and lower the risk of heart disease. You can find these fats in fatty fish like salmon, flaxseeds, and walnuts. Omega-6 fats are found in vegetable oils, but it’s important to keep a balance between omega-3 and omega-6 intake.</p>

      <h2>Take Action:</h2>
      <p>• <strong>Avoid:</strong> Processed snacks, fried foods, margarine, and high-fat dairy products that contain trans and saturated fats.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Embrace:</strong> Olive oil, nuts, avocados, salmon, flaxseeds, and other sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Read labels:</strong> Always check nutrition labels for trans fats and hydrogenated oils.</p>
