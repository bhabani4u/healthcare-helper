      <p>Food and nutrition can sometimes be confusing, but understanding the basics of calories, carbohydrates, proteins, and fats is important for your health. Let’s break it down:</p>

      <p>• <strong>Calories:</strong> They measure the energy your body uses from food.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> The body’s primary energy source, found in grains, fruits, and veggies.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Proteins:</strong> Essential for building and repairing tissues, found in meats, dairy, and legumes.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Fats:</strong> Provide energy and support cell function, but not all fats are created equal—focus on healthy fats like those from fish, nuts, and seeds.</p>
