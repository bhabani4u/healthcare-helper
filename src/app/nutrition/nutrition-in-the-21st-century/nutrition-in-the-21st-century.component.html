      Nutrition in the 21st Century (Organics, Pesticides, Refined Foods)
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>The food we eat today is vastly different from what our great-grandparents consumed. Over the past century, the rise of refined foods, pesticides, and chemical additives has transformed our diets. While modern advancements have improved food availability, questions linger about the safety of certain ingredients. For example, potassium bromate and food dyes like Red 40 are banned in Europe but allowed in the U.S., sparking ongoing debates about their health impacts.</p>

      <h2>Organics vs. Pesticides</h2>
      <p>The rise of organic foods reflects growing concerns about pesticides and chemical residues. Organic farming avoids synthetic pesticides, which some studies suggest may be linked to long-term health risks. Though often more expensive, many people choose organic products to reduce exposure to chemicals.</p>

      <h2>Processed and Refined Foods</h2>
      <p>The convenience of processed and refined foods has dramatically altered our diets. However, these foods are often loaded with added sugars, unhealthy fats, and preservatives that can contribute to chronic health conditions like obesity and heart disease.</p>

      <h2>The Future of Food</h2>
      <p>As food evolves, more focus is being placed on sustainable and ethical food production, lab-grown meats, and alternative proteins such as insects. Genetic modification is another area of interest, with genetically modified organisms (GMOs) contributing to both increased yields and controversy over long-term health effects.</p>

      <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
      <p>• Eat Whole Foods: Stick to fresh produce, lean proteins, and whole grains.</p>
      <p>• Choose Organics: Consider organic options to reduce pesticide exposure.</p>
      <p>• Limit Processed Foods: Cook meals at home to avoid added sugars and preservatives.</p>
      <p>• Stay Informed: Keep up with ongoing research and food safety regulations to make informed choices.</p>

      <p>The food landscape will continue to evolve, so it's essential to be aware of how these changes affect your health. By focusing on whole foods and minimizing processed ingredients, you can adapt to modern nutrition in a healthier way.</p>
