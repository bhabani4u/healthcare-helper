      Is Your Plate Heart Healthy?
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Heart disease remains a leading cause of death, but you can reduce your risk by making simple changes to your diet. A heart-healthy plate should balance lean proteins, whole grains, healthy fats, and plenty of vegetables.</p>

      <p>First off, let’s talk about the heart. It pulses nonstop from the moment you are in your mother’s womb until your last breath. That means your heart will need to pump for around 100 years! Doing what we can to support this incredibly powerful muscle will ensure we live the best life possible.</p>

      <p>You are what you eat. You want to avoid the insides of your heart, your arteries, and your veins from getting clogged with a waxy substance called cholesterol. You can do this by eating well.</p>

      <h2>If:</h2>
      <p>• you have poor circulation / your hands/feet get cold easily, you get muscle cramps easily</p>
      <p>• you get out of breath easily, or you get tired easily</p>
      <p>• you eat unhealthy foods</p>

      <p>These are all tied to your heart health, and how well you will feel as you get older.</p>

      <p>There are certain foods that it is important you avoid eating for your future. There are also certain foods you want to add to your diet in order to improve your heart health. Here’s how you can whip your plate into heart-healthy shape:</p>
      <p>• Choose lean proteins like chicken, fish, or plant-based options.</p>
      <p>• Fill half your plate with vegetables that are rich in nutrients and low in calories.</p>
      <p>• Add healthy fats like olive oil, nuts, and seeds for heart protection.</p>
      <p>• Limit refined carbs and sugar that can lead to weight gain and high cholesterol.</p>

      <h2>Practical Tips:</h2>
      <p>1. Cut Back on Salt: High sodium levels can raise blood pressure. Use herbs and spices to flavor your food instead. Reducing salt from your diet takes time. Americans eat 15 pounds more salt per year than is recommended. Many American-influenced restaurants will serve foods that are too salty. In order to cut down your salt, you have to be patient. Your body always wants to create a habit. If you make any change in your life, it will be uncomfortable at first because your body will not want to adjust. But if you give yourself just two weeks reducing your salt, it will be much easier for you to then get to 3 months, at which point you will hardly notice.</p>

      <p>2. Cut down on sugars! When you are young and active, sugar is so helpful to regain your energy quickly. But as we get older, especially if we exercise less, we need less sugar. But if we have a habit of enjoying sweet foods, it becomes harder to stop. Women should consume daily average 6 teaspoons of sugar max, and men 9 max. Americans consume 22! One can of soda has 39 grams of sugar. Minimize pastries, donuts, ice cream, sweetened drinks like sweetened coffee, tea, and soda</p>

      <p>3. Opt for Whole Grains: Switch out refined grains for whole grains like quinoa, brown rice, or whole-wheat bread. Fiber stops your body from digesting bad cholesterol. Just a small increase of fiber each day will protect your body.</p>

      <p>4. Watch Portion Sizes: In Japan, portion sizes are significantly smaller than in the US. This is not a source of concern for the Japanese; they are simply used to consuming less food. Our bodies can make a habit out of anything, and it will adapt over time. Eating smaller portions will cause our stomachs to shrink, which in turn will cause us to feel full faster. Overeating—even healthy food—can lead to weight gain and increased heart disease risk. Practice portion control.</p>

      <p>Why do we do this? Because it’s not enough to live, but we must work hard to live well. We live in a country where people make money selling you things that you might want, even if it is not good for you. You must protect yourself, and each other. And your grandchildren will not know this is a problem unless you help them understand that getting what you want won’t make you happy. Living a healthy life filled with wisdom and joy are really important.</p>

      <p>Incorporating these changes will help lower your chance of heart disease while keeping your meals satisfying and nutritious!</p>
