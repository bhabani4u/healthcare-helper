      How Nutrition Changes as You Age
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>As we age, our bodies undergo changes that affect metabolism, taste, and digestion. Understanding these shifts can help us make better dietary choices for optimal health.</p>

      <h2>Metabolism Slows:</h2>
      <p>As metabolism slows, calorie needs decrease. Focus on nutrient-dense foods like vegetables, fruits, and lean proteins. The approximate amount of calories needed per day will vary by your activity level.</p>

          <tr>
            <td>Somewhat active</td>
            <td>1,800</td>
            <td>2,200</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Very active</td>
            <td>2,000</td>
            <td>2,400</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>Eat fewer calories if you need to, but focus on nutritious options. Staying within your calorie limits may help you prevent sneaky weight gain, but make sure your calories are coming from nutritious sources.</p>

      <h2>Taste Buds Diminish:</h2>
      <p>Older adults may notice that food tastes different. As you get older, your senses of taste and smell may fade. This is because taste buds tend to decrease in size and number and nerves in the nose begin to deteriorate. Salty and sweet go first, bitter and sour remain the longest. Experiment with herbs and spices to add flavor without adding too much salt.</p>

      <p>Decreasing senses may make you more likely to overdo the salt, reach for sweets more often and lead to other problems. To help deal with diminishing taste:</p>
      <p>• Try to stay below 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day.4 The USDA recommends adults age 51+ keep their daily sodium intake to less than 1,500 mg, or about two-thirds of a teaspoon.</p>
      <p>• Limit added sugar to 6 teaspoons per day for women and 9 teaspoons per day for men.5 This recommendation, from the American Heart Association, will help you reign in your sugar intake.</p>
      <p>• Experiment with herbs and spices. Different seasonings work best with different foods. Use the chart below to help you season without salt.</p>
      <p>• Choose foods that are naturally sweet. Instead of adding sugar to your meals, or eating foods with lots of added sugars, try to increase sweetness with naturally sweet foods like fruits, peppers or yams.</p>
      <p>• Engage your other senses at meal times. Choose brightly colored foods to satisfy your eyes and use a variety of textures to keep things interesting.</p>

      <h2>Digestive Changes:</h2>
      <p>With age, the digestive system may become more sensitive. Increase fiber intake through whole grains, fruits, and vegetables to maintain healthy digestion and prevent constipation. The muscles of the digestive tract become stiffer and weaker, and slowing digestion may lead to constipation. Plus, medications and chronic health conditions can negatively impact digestion.</p>

      <p>The various changes in the digestive tract make food choices more important than ever before. To help keep your digestive system healthy:</p>
      <p>• Exercise may help. Exercise increases blood flow to all of your organs, helps you to keep a healthy weight and keeps food moving through your digestive tract.</p>
      <p>• Reduce your stress levels. Try to manage your stress by avoiding your stressors, exercising, and/or doing relaxation exercises like deep breathing and meditation.</p>
      <p>• Focus on fiber. Fiber keeps food moving through your digestive system.</p>
      <p>• Know your triggers. Figuring out what’s causing your digestive issues can help you learn what to avoid in the future.</p>
      <p>• Stay hydrated. Water helps keep stool soft and easy to pass.</p>
      <p>• Work with your healthcare provider to manage digestion problems. Talk to your healthcare provider about any digestive problems you’re experiencing.</p>

      <h2>Nutrient Absorption Declines:</h2>
      <p>Nutrients like calcium, vitamin D, and B12 may become harder to absorb. Incorporate fortified foods or supplements if necessary, especially for bone and brain health.</p>

      <p>As adults age, nutrient absorption can decline due to factors such as reduced stomach acid, slower metabolism, and changes in the digestive system. To combat this, it's important to ensure that older adults:</p>
      <p>• Eat nutrient-dense foods: Include more whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.</p>
      <p>• Supplement as needed: Common deficiencies include calcium, vitamin D, B12, and magnesium, which may require supplements.</p>
      <p>• Improve digestion: Encourage small, frequent meals and maintain hydration.</p>
      <p>• Stay physically active: Exercise can help improve metabolism and nutrient absorption.</p>

      <h2>Stay Hydrated:</h2>
      <p>Older adults are at higher risk of dehydration. Drink plenty of water throughout the day, and eat hydrating foods like cucumbers and watermelon.</p>

      <p>Older adults are at a higher risk for dehydration due to several factors:</p>
      <p>• Reduced thirst sensation: As people age, they may not feel thirsty as often, making them less likely to drink water.</p>
      <p>• Decreased kidney function: Aging kidneys are less efficient at conserving water, leading to increased fluid loss.</p>
      <p>• Medications: Many medications taken by older adults, such as diuretics or laxatives, can increase fluid loss.</p>
      <p>• Chronic conditions: Health issues like diabetes or cognitive decline may affect fluid intake.</p>
      <p>• Mobility issues: Difficulty moving or accessing water may reduce fluid intake.</p>

      <p>To combat dehydration, it's important for older adults to consciously drink water regularly, even if they do not feel thirsty, and consult with healthcare providers about hydration needs.</p>

      <p>Socrates, the famous Greek philosopher once stated, “Know Thyself.” No matter our age, understand our bodies, our feelings, and our needs is very important for us to take care of ourselves. So take care of yourself. You are worth it!</p>
