      Sneaky Sodium: Where Are You Hiding?
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Sodium is an essential mineral your body needs to function. It helps maintain fluid balance, send nerve impulses, and contract muscles. However, too much sodium can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. The American Heart Association recommends consuming no more than <strong>1,500 mg</strong> of sodium daily, but many Americans consume over <strong>3,400 mg</strong>—largely from processed and restaurant foods.</p>

      <h2>Effects of too much sodium</h2>
      <p>According to the American Heart Association, 90% of Americans consume too much sodium.3 Your kidneys are responsible for getting rid of excess sodium, but in some cases, they can’t eliminate enough.</p>
      <p>Consuming too much sodium affects many parts of the body, including the heart. Too much sodium is linked to heart disease, hypertension, heart failure and stroke.</p>

      <h2>Recommended daily sodium intake</h2>
      <p>Your body only needs <strong>180 to 500 mg</strong> of sodium each day to function properly—that’s less than the amount in one-quarter of a teaspoon of salt.</p>

      <h2>Tips to Cut Sodium:</h2>
      <p>• Choose fresh or "no salt added" foods.</p>
      <p>• Use herbs and spices for flavor instead of salt.</p>
      <p>• Drain and rinse canned foods.</p>
      <p>• Limit portion sizes when dining out.</p>

      <p>By making small changes, you can lower your sodium intake and improve your heart health. Always check food labels and be mindful of sodium-heavy products like breads, cold cuts, and savory snacks.</p>

      <h2>Top sources of sodium</h2>
      <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 77% of sodium in the average American diet comes from processed and restaurant foods6 and more than 40% of the sodium Americans eat each day comes from just these 10 types of foods:</p>
      <p>• Breads and rolls</p>
      <p>• Pizza</p>
      <p>• Sandwiches</p>
      <p>• Cured meats and cold cuts</p>
      <p>• Soups</p>
      <p>• Burritos and tacos</p>
      <p>• Savory snacks</p>
      <p>• Chicken</p>
      <p>• Cheese</p>
      <p>• Eggs and omelets</p>

      <p>Making small reductions in sodium may help lower your risk of high blood pressure, heart attack and stroke.</p>
