      <p>• <strong>Blue/Purple:</strong> Packed with anthocyanins, these foods support brain health and reduce inflammation. (e.g., blueberries, eggplant)</p>
      <p>• <strong>White/Brown:</strong> Often overlooked, these foods contain antioxidants like allicin and can boost the immune system and heart health. (e.g., garlic, onions)</p>
