      Disability Insurance Benefits Can Help Protect Your Ability To Earn
    </div>

    <div class="card-body">
      <p>When most people think about protecting their assets, they often think of their home or retirement savings as their most important assets. However, if you're still working, your ability to earn an income is by far your most valuable asset. Without it, you might struggle to cover your daily expenses, let alone save for the future. This is where disability insurance comes in—providing a safety net in case you're unable to work due to illness or injury.</p>

      <h2>What Is Disability Insurance?</h2>
      <p>Disability insurance is designed to replace a portion of your income if you’re unable to work due to a disability. It ensures that you can still pay bills and maintain your lifestyle while you recover. There are two main types of disability insurance:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Short-term Disability Insurance (STD): Provides benefits for a few weeks to up to a year. This coverage is often offered by employers and kicks in once your sick leave is exhausted.</p></li>
        <li><p>Long-term Disability Insurance (LTD): Pays benefits if you’re still disabled after your short-term coverage ends. It can cover you for many years, sometimes up to retirement age.</p></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Real-World Scenarios Where Disability Insurance Is Crucial</h2>
      <p>Disability insurance can make all the difference in various real-world scenarios, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Unexpected Injuries: If you’re in an accident that leaves you unable to work for an extended period, disability insurance will help cover living expenses while you recover.</p></li>
        <li><p>Chronic Illnesses: Conditions such as cancer, heart disease, or severe mental health disorders could leave you unable to work for months or even years. Disability insurance ensures that you still have income coming in.</p></li>
        <li><p>Serious Health Conditions: If you experience a long-term illness, such as multiple sclerosis, and are unable to work, LTD insurance can provide a steady income for the duration of your inability to work.</p></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Much Does Disability Insurance Typically Cost?</h2>
      <p>The cost of disability insurance is influenced by various factors, including your age, health, occupation, and the level of coverage you choose. Premiums typically range from 1% to 3% of your annual salary for long-term policies. While this may seem like a significant expense, it's important to weigh the costs against the potential risk of losing your income entirely. Most people would find it difficult to survive even a few months without income.</p>

      <h2>What to Look For in a Policy</h2>
      <p>Here are some key elements to consider when evaluating disability insurance:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Benefit Amount: How much of your income will the policy replace? Typical coverage ranges from 40% to 60% of your pre-disability income.</p></li>
        <li><p>Waiting Period: How long after you become disabled before benefits begin? Longer waiting periods can reduce your premiums but require you to have savings to cover the interim period.</p></li>
        <li><p>Benefit Period: How long will the policy pay benefits? Long-term disability policies often cover you until you reach retirement age, but shorter benefit periods are also available.</p></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Protect Your Ability to Earn</h2>
      <p>Disability insurance is a vital tool in your financial plan, especially if you rely heavily on your income to meet your day-to-day expenses and long-term financial goals. If an unexpected injury or illness prevents you from working, having the right disability coverage can help safeguard your financial future.</p>
      <p>Next Steps: Evaluate your current health, job risks, and existing employer-provided benefits. Consider supplementing your coverage with a private disability insurance policy if needed, and consult a financial advisor to ensure your policy fits within your overall financial plan</p>
