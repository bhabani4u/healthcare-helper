    <div class="card-body">
      <!-- Introduction Section -->
      <p>
        Vaccines have been one of the most significant advancements in modern medicine, playing a crucial role in preventing infectious diseases and improving public health. Understanding how vaccines work, their benefits, and addressing common misconceptions can help individuals make informed decisions about their health. Here’s an in-depth look at vaccines and their impact on disease prevention.
      </p>

      <!-- How Vaccines Work Section -->
      <h4>How Vaccines Work</h4>
      <p>Vaccines help protect against diseases by stimulating the immune system to recognize and fight pathogens.</p>

      <!-- Immune System Basics Section -->
      <h5>1. Immune System Basics</h5>
      <p>The immune system is the body’s defense mechanism against infections, composed of various cells and proteins that detect and eliminate pathogens like bacteria and viruses.</p>

      <!-- Vaccine Mechanism Section -->
      <h5>2. Vaccine Mechanism</h5>
      <p>Vaccines typically contain weakened or inactivated parts of a particular organism (antigen) that triggers an immune response within the body without causing the disease.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Live-Attenuated Vaccines:</strong> Contain a weakened form of the germ (e.g., measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine).</li>
        <li><strong>Inactivated Vaccines:</strong> Contain killed versions of the germ (e.g., polio vaccine).</li>
        <li><strong>Subunit, Recombinant, and Conjugate Vaccines:</strong> Contain specific pieces of the germ (e.g., HPV and hepatitis B vaccines).</li>
        <li><strong>mRNA Vaccines:</strong> Use messenger RNA to instruct cells to produce a protein that triggers an immune response (e.g., COVID-19 vaccines like Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna).</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Immune Response Section -->
      <h5>3. Immune Response</h5>
      <p>Once vaccinated, the immune system recognizes the antigen as foreign and mounts an immune response. This response includes the production of antibodies, which remain in the body and provide immunity. If exposed to the actual pathogen in the future, the immune system can respond more rapidly and effectively.</p>

      <!-- Benefits of Vaccination Section -->
      <h4>Benefits of Vaccination</h4>
      <p>Vaccination offers numerous benefits for individuals and communities, contributing to overall public health.</p>

      <!-- Disease Prevention Section -->
      <h5>1. Disease Prevention</h5>
      <p>Vaccines protect individuals from infectious diseases that can cause severe illness, complications, or death.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Eradication of Diseases:</strong> Smallpox was eradicated globally through vaccination efforts, and polio is close to being eradicated.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Disease Transmission:</strong> Vaccination reduces the spread of contagious diseases, protecting those who cannot be vaccinated, such as infants and immunocompromised individuals.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Herd Immunity Section -->
      <h5>2. Herd Immunity</h5>
      <p>When a significant portion of the population is vaccinated, herd immunity is achieved, making the spread of infectious diseases less likely.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Community Protection:</strong> Herd immunity protects vulnerable populations who cannot receive vaccines due to medical conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Outbreak Prevention:</strong> High vaccination rates prevent disease outbreaks and epidemics.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Economic and Social Benefits Section -->
      <h5>3. Economic and Social Benefits</h5>
      <p>Vaccination has significant economic and social benefits.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Healthcare Cost Savings:</strong> Vaccines reduce healthcare costs by preventing hospitalizations and long-term complications.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Quality of Life:</strong> Preventing diseases through vaccination allows individuals to lead healthier, more productive lives.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Common Vaccines and Their Importance Section -->
      <h4>Common Vaccines and Their Importance</h4>
      <p>Several vaccines are recommended for older adults to protect against specific diseases.</p>

      <!-- Influenza (Flu) Vaccine Section -->
      <h5>1. Influenza (Flu) Vaccine</h5>
      <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Protects against seasonal influenza, which can cause severe illness, especially in older adults.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Annual vaccination is recommended for everyone aged 65 and older.</p>

      <!-- Pneumococcal Vaccine Section -->
      <h5>2. Pneumococcal Vaccine</h5>
      <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Protects against pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia, meningitis, and bloodstream infections.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Two types of pneumococcal vaccines (PCV13 and PPSV23) are recommended for adults aged 65 and older.</p>

      <!-- Shingles (Herpes Zoster) Vaccine Section -->
      <h5>3. Shingles (Herpes Zoster) Vaccine</h5>
      <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Prevents shingles, a painful rash caused by the reactivation of the chickenpox virus, and its complications.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Shingrix is recommended for adults aged 50 and older.</p>

      <!-- Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis (Tdap) Vaccine Section -->
      <h5>4. Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis (Tdap) Vaccine</h5>
      <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Protects against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (whooping cough).</p>
      <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> A one-time Tdap vaccine is recommended, followed by a Td booster every 10 years.</p>

      <!-- COVID-19 Vaccine Section -->
      <h5>5. COVID-19 Vaccine</h5>

      <p>Despite the overwhelming evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of vaccines, misconceptions persist. Addressing these myths is crucial for informed decision-making.</p>

      <!-- Vaccines Cause Autism Myth Section -->
      <h5>1. Vaccines Cause Autism</h5>
      <p><strong>Myth:</strong> The myth that vaccines cause autism originated from a discredited study.</p>
