      Seasonal Allergies - Relief from Wheezing and Sneezing
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Seasonal allergies can be miserable, but understanding the triggers and how to manage them can bring relief. Outdoor molds, trees, grasses, and weeds release pollen and spores, leading to sneezing, itching, congestion, and fatigue. Pollen levels are highest from spring to fall, especially on dry, windy days. These allergens cause your immune system to release histamines, which lead to common allergy symptoms.</p>

      <h2>What Are Histamines?</h2>
      <p>Histamines are chemicals produced by your immune system in response to allergens. They cause inflammation and swelling in areas like your nasal passages, throat, and eyes. This swelling, while a defense mechanism, can lead to congestion and breathing problems, making it harder to catch your breath or even leading to asthma exacerbation in some people.</p>

      <h2>How Allergies Affect Breathing</h2>
      <p>For people prone to breathing issues, such as asthma sufferers, allergies can make it harder to breathe by narrowing airways, increasing mucus production, and irritating the respiratory system. This can result in wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. Prolonged exposure to allergens can also worsen chronic breathing conditions.</p>

      <h2>How to Prevent &amp; Treat Allergies</h2>
      <p>• Wear a mask outdoors and avoid being outside on windy days.</p>
      <p>• Check pollen counts before heading out. Pollen levels peak in the morning, so try to schedule activities for later in the day, especially after a rainstorm, which clears pollen from the air.</p>
      <p>• Wash your clothes after being outside, and shower to remove pollen from your hair and skin.</p>
      <p>• Regularly clean your home, vacuum often, and use HEPA filters in air purifiers and vacuums to trap allergens.</p>
      <p>• Antihistamines, decongestants, and nasal rinses like Neti pots can help relieve symptoms.</p>
      <p>• For long-term relief, consult with an allergist about allergy shots or a skin panel test to identify specific triggers.</p>

      <h2>Long-Term Allergy Treatment</h2>
      <p>Allergy immunization therapy, commonly known as allergy shots, is a long-term treatment option that helps desensitize your body to allergens. Over time, small doses of the allergen are introduced to train your immune system not to overreact. This gradual process can reduce or even eliminate symptoms for many sufferers.</p>

      <p>By staying proactive and incorporating these steps into your routine, you can minimize allergy symptoms and find relief during the allergy season. For the most up-to-date pollen forecasts, check your local TV station, newspaper, or weather app.</p>
