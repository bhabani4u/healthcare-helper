      Boost Your Digestion
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Are you suffering from heartburn, bloating, or constipation? These common digestive issues could be your body’s way of telling you something important about your gastrointestinal (GI) health. Understanding how digestion works can help you make simple changes to improve your digestive system and overall well-being.</p>

      <h2>How Digestion Works</h2>
      <p>Digestion begins in the mouth and involves breaking down food into nutrients that your body absorbs. When any part of the digestive process is off balance, it can lead to discomfort, nutrient deficiencies, and even more serious health problems over time.</p>

      <h2>Common Digestive Issues and What They Mean</h2>
      <p>• <strong>Heartburn:</strong> Often a sign of acid reflux, where stomach acid irritates the esophagus.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Bloating:</strong> Can be caused by overeating, gas, or food intolerances.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Constipation:</strong> Signals that the digestive system is moving too slowly, often due to low fiber or dehydration.</p>

      <h2>Tips to Boost Your Digestion</h2>

      <h2>1. Eat More Fiber</h2>
      <p>Fiber-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains help keep things moving through your digestive system, reducing the risk of constipation.</p>

      <h2>2. Stay Hydrated</h2>
      <p>Water is essential for breaking down food and moving it through your intestines. Aim to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day.</p>

      <h2>3. Chew Your Food Slowly</h2>
      <p>Digestion starts in your mouth. Chewing food thoroughly helps your stomach digest food more efficiently, reducing the likelihood of bloating and indigestion.</p>

      <h2>4. Manage Stress</h2>
      <p>Stress can negatively affect digestion by causing the body to go into "fight or flight" mode, slowing down the digestive process. Practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing or yoga can aid digestion.</p>

      <h2>5. Avoid Overeating</h2>
      <p>Large meals can overload your digestive system. Eating smaller, more frequent meals allows your digestive tract to function more efficiently.</p>

      <h2>6. Get Moving</h2>
      <p>Physical activity helps stimulate digestion. A short walk after meals can boost your digestive function and help prevent constipation.</p>

      <h2>7. Limit Trigger Foods</h2>
      <p>Foods like caffeine, spicy foods, and fried items can exacerbate heartburn or bloating. Pay attention to how your body reacts to specific foods and make adjustments as necessary.</p>

      <p>If you’re experiencing frequent digestive issues, your body is signaling that something needs to change. Simple behaviors such as adding more fiber, drinking water, managing stress, and being mindful of your eating habits can make a big difference in your digestive health.</p>
      <p>By following these steps, you’ll be on your way to boosting your gastrointestinal health and feeling more comfortable day to day. Start listening to what your body is telling you and take small steps toward better digestion!</p>
