      <p>Reaching 100 and staying functional isn’t just about genetics; lifestyle plays a huge role. Centenarians share common habits that contribute to their longevity. Here’s what they do and how you can adopt their secrets for living a longer, healthier life.</p>

      <h2>1. Prioritize Physical Activity</h2>
      <p>Centenarians stay active, but they don’t necessarily hit the gym. They integrate movement into daily activities, like walking, gardening, or dancing. Regular activity keeps muscles strong, helps with balance, and maintains cardiovascular health.</p>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Aim for at least 30 minutes of movement a day. It could be as simple as a brisk walk.</p>

      <h2>2. Eat a Plant-Based Diet</h2>
      <p>Many centenarians follow a primarily plant-based diet, rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes. These nutrient-dense foods are linked to lower risks of chronic diseases and promote longevity.</p>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Focus on a diet rich in colorful vegetables and limit processed foods. Consider incorporating more plant-based meals into your routine.</p>

      <h2>3. Social Engagement</h2>
      <p>Staying socially connected plays a key role in longevity. Centenarians often have strong family ties and participate in community activities, which contribute to emotional well-being.</p>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Make time for friends and loved ones. Join community activities or clubs to keep your social connections vibrant.</p>

      <h2>4. Manage Stress</h2>
      <p>Centenarians have a unique ability to manage stress. Whether through meditation, mindfulness, or simply having a positive outlook on life, they avoid letting stress consume them.</p>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Develop stress-relief practices, like deep breathing, meditation, or spending time in nature.</p>

      <h2>5. Sleep Well</h2>
      <p>Good sleep is essential for physical and mental recovery. Centenarians prioritize rest, ensuring their bodies have time to heal and function optimally.</p>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night and maintain a consistent bedtime routine.</p>

      <p>Living to 100 and staying functional is possible with the right habits. By adopting these simple changes—staying active, eating well, staying socially engaged, managing stress, and getting good sleep—you can increase your chances of living a long, healthy life.</p>
