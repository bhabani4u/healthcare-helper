      Simple Steps to Boost Your Immune System
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Your immune system is your body’s defense against harmful invaders like bacteria, viruses, and toxins. It's a complex system with two key players: white blood cells and lymphocytes. Think of white blood cells as a military defense force, actively seeking out and attacking threats. Lymphocytes, meanwhile, are like the FBI, storing information on previous threats and preparing defense plans for future threat of attack. Together, they keep you healthy by fighting off infections and diseases.</p>

      <p>By adopting a few healthy habits, you can strengthen your immune system and help keep illnesses at bay. Here are some simple, effective ways to give your immune system a boost:</p>

      <h2>1. Eat a Balanced Diet</h2>
      <p>A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains provides essential vitamins and minerals that support immune function. Nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc are particularly important for keeping your immune system strong. Incorporate colorful vegetables, berries, nuts, and seeds into your daily meals for a nutrient-dense diet that boosts your body’s defense.</p>

      <h2>2. Stay Active</h2>
      <p>Regular exercise can promote good circulation, allowing immune cells to move freely and do their job effectively. It strengthens your bones and muscles, and helps release stress-reducing hormones. Exercise also reduces inflammation and may help the immune system respond better to infections. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate activity or 2 ½ hours each week, such as brisk walking, strength training, cycling, or swimming, most days of the week.</p>

      <h2>3. Get Enough Sleep</h2>
      <p>Your body repairs itself while you sleep, and this includes your immune system. This means that without adequate sleep, your body is not healing as optimally as it could. Lack of sleep can weaken your body’s defense mechanisms and make you more susceptible to illness.</p>
      <p>It’s a myth that you require less sleep as you get older. Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night to allow your immune system to function at its best.</p>

      <h2>4. Manage Stress</h2>
      <p>Chronic stress can suppress immune function by increasing the production of stress hormones, such as cortisol. Finding ways to relax can reduce this impact and support a stronger immune response. Chronic stress triggers your body's fight-or-flight response, which can weaken your immune system over time by increasing the amount of cortisol in your body. This prepares your body for attack, and suppresses your body’s healing capability. Use stress management techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to help your body relax and focus on maintaining your health.</p>

      <h2>5. Stay Hydrated</h2>
      <p>Water is essential for many bodily functions, including supporting the immune system. Hydration helps flush toxins from the body and keeps the immune system working efficiently.</p>
      <p>Drink plenty of water throughout the day—about 8 glasses or more depending on your activity level and climate.</p>

      <h2>6. Preventive Care</h2>
      <p>Simple habits like washing your hands, brushing your teeth twice daily, and avoiding sharing utensils can prevent the spread of germs. Regular vaccines, such as for the flu or pneumonia, can provide an added layer of protection.</p>

      <h2>Take Action</h2>
      <p>Boosting your immune system doesn’t require drastic changes. Start with simple steps like eating a nutrient-rich diet, staying active, managing stress, and prioritizing sleep and hydration. These habits will help your body stay strong and ready to fend off illness.</p>
      <p>Incorporate these habits into your daily routine to support long-term health and give your immune system the best chance to protect you!</p>
