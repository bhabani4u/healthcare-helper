    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Making healthy changes to your lifestyle—whether it's eating better, exercising more, or managing stress—can seem overwhelming, but breaking it down into small, manageable steps makes it more achievable. Here are seven simple steps to guide you:</p>

      <h2>1. Start Small</h2>
      <p>Don’t try to overhaul everything at once. Pick one habit to change at a time. For example, start by drinking more water daily before making broader diet changes.</p>

      <h2>2. Set Specific, Measurable Goals</h2>
      <p>It’s easier to track progress when your goals are clear. Instead of saying, “I’ll exercise more,” set a goal like, “I’ll walk for 20 minutes, three times a week.”</p>

      <h2>3. Plan Ahead</h2>
      <p>Whether it’s meal prepping healthy foods or scheduling workout times, having a plan in place increases your chances of success.</p>

      <h2>4. Build a Support System</h2>
      <p>Share your goals with friends or family, or join a community group. Supportive people can provide encouragement and hold you accountable.</p>

      <h2>5. Track Your Progress</h2>
      <p>Keep a journal or use apps to track your food intake, workouts, and stress management activities. Tracking helps you stay mindful of your progress and areas needing improvement.</p>

      <h2>6. Be Kind to Yourself</h2>
      <p>Setbacks are part of the process. Instead of beating yourself up, focus on what you can do better tomorrow.</p>

      <h2>7. Celebrate Small Wins</h2>
      <p>Acknowledge your progress, even if it seems small. Celebrating your achievements can keep you motivated and help you stay on track.</p>

      <p>Change doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Follow these seven steps, start small, stay focused, and be patient with yourself. Before long, you’ll see positive results in your health and well-being!</p>
