      <p>You eat well and stay active, yet the scale creeps up. What’s going on? Here are five sneaky pitfalls that may be causing unexpected weight gain:</p>

      <h2>1. Portion Control Creep</h2>
      <p>Even healthy foods can lead to weight gain if eaten in large portions. Pay attention to serving sizes to keep calories in check.</p>

      <h2>2. Hidden Sugars</h2>
      <p>Foods marketed as "healthy" can be packed with hidden sugars, especially in items like smoothies and granola. Check the labels!</p>

      <h2>3. Stress Eating</h2>
      <p>Chronic stress increases cortisol levels, which can lead to cravings for high-fat, high-sugar foods, adding more calories than you realize.</p>

      <h2>4. Not Enough Sleep</h2>
      <p>Lack of sleep can slow metabolism and increase hunger hormones, leading to overeating.</p>

      <h2>5. Skipping Strength Training</h2>
      <p>While cardio is great, neglecting strength training can lead to muscle loss, slowing your metabolism. Incorporate weight training to maintain lean mass.</p>

      <p><strong>Pay close attention to these sneaky causes and tweak your habits to stay on track!</strong></p>
