      <h2>What Puts You at Risk for Falls?</h2>
      <p>• <strong>Balance and Gait Issues:</strong> As we age, decreased coordination and balance can make falls more likely.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Medications:</strong> Certain medications can cause dizziness or drowsiness, increasing fall risk.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Vision Impairments:</strong> Changes in vision can make it harder to see hazards.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Home Hazards:</strong> Clutter, loose rugs, and poorly lit areas are common culprits.</p>

      <h2>Ways to Prevent Falls</h2>
      <p>• <strong>Exercise Regularly:</strong> Strength and balance exercises like tai chi can help improve coordination and reduce fall risk.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Manage Medications:</strong> Review medications with your doctor to minimize side effects like dizziness.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Check Vision:</strong> Regular eye exams can ensure you have the right prescription to reduce falls.</p>

      <h2>Tips to Fall-Proof Your Home</h2>
      <p>• <strong>Remove Clutter:</strong> Keep walkways clear of tripping hazards like shoes, cords, and other objects.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Install Grab Bars:</strong> Place grab bars in bathrooms near the toilet and shower.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Improve Lighting:</strong> Ensure your home is well-lit, especially in hallways and staircases.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Secure Rugs:</strong> Use non-slip mats under rugs or remove them entirely to avoid tripping.</p>

      <h2>Additional Tips</h2>
      <p>• <strong>Footwear Matters:</strong> Wear non-slip shoes, even indoors, to reduce the risk of slipping.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Get Regular Health Check-Ups:</strong> Staying on top of your overall health, including heart and blood pressure checks, can also help reduce fall risk.</p>
