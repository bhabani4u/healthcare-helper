                    <p>Healthcare Helpers is a team of professional Healthcare Advisors who are licensed to provide health and life insurance advice. Healthcare Helper's philosophy is centered around educating each member so they are empowered to make their own decisions. While we will share our frank opinion on which plan option make be in your best interest, it is ultimately you who must decide, without pressure from agents.</p>
                    <p>A good experience in any relationship requires that we are able to be ourselves while at the same time being able to respect the differences of others. Our success has come from building long term relationships with all our members, so they know they can count on us to be there whenever they need advice or assistance.</p>
                    <p>Life is difficult. No one goes through life unscathed by the burdens of age, and the loss that each of us will inevitably face as our youth disappears and those we love depart. Despite all of the things that make us distinct and different from one another, there is much more that connects us, and in particular, our shared sufferings.</p>

                <img src="/assets/gordon-welty.jpg" />
                <p>Gordon Welty is the Founder and Principal of Healthcare Helpers. A Southern California native, he
                  grew up witnessing his mother pass away from a treatable cancer at age 50, and began to experience
                  health problems himself at age 40.</p>
                <p>After serving in the US Marines after high school, Gordon completed his bachelor’s degree at UCLA and
                  moved into the nonprofit world, both locally, then internationally, where he founded a nonprofit to
                  build schools and medical clinics for refugees fleeing conflict in the country known as Myanmar
                  (Burma).</p>
                <p>After returning to the US, Mr. Welty became a project manager for a successful construction and
                  technology company before transitioning into the sales industry, where he thrived. With a strong
                  distaste for pressure sales tactics, he decided he would seek out his own consultative and
                  engineering-minded approach to sales, and eventually moved into the healthcare industry.</p>
